> There are some guide to correctly configure parameters?

The parameter description is written in readme (ros / src / computing / perception / localization / packages / lidar_localizer / nodes / ndt_slam / README.md).
But I do not write how to configure them.

> What Lidar is used in this video?

Velodyne HDL-32e.

Thank you for sending rosbag.
I tried several times, but the mapping  is quite difficult because there is a timing that only one pole is visible.

As a solution
・ (Recommended) Use VLP-32c etc.
VLP-32c can be seen up to 200m. So it can see the building even from the end of the circuit.
・Fusion Odometry, IMU, GNSS with EKF. We are developing this feature.

Also, this is a hack method, but you can temporarily stop the mapping and skip the locations where localization is lost, as shown below.
1. Mapping until just before localization is lost
1. pause the rosbag
1. kill ndt_slam and save the map
1. publish the map saved from Map tab of RuntimeManager
1. launch ndt_slam with `With Mapping` turned off
1. play rosbag until you can see buildings around.
1. Align self-position with 2D Pose Estimate.
1. After confirming that the self position is stable, set `With Mapping` to ON.

For your refarence, the best parameter I configured.(Note: Position estimation is lost on the way)

I checked this, and it was because I changed the vehicle position when gazebo simulation was stopped. I'll change figure and also post here for more info.

MPC waypoints follower,2019-05-20T05:04:52Z,443733498,493839953.0,comment,"@amc-nu Answers to your question are

1.  The `mpc_follower` can use more information to follow waypoints, which enables to follow waypoints accurately. The features of the two followers are
 - `pure_pursuit` plans to move towards the **one lookahead waypoint**, assuming that **the route has constant curvature** and **angular velocity can be realized ideally**.  
 -  `mpc_follower` plans considering with **all points on the path** and **vehicle dynamics (such as steering delay)** to follow the waypoints.
2. MPC performs better when you want to drive at **complex route with low tracking error** (where the assumption of ""route has constant curvature"" is not apprpriate). While, the drawbacks of MPC are
 -  the difficulty of parameter tuning (it requires knowledge of control theory and vehicle dynamics). 
 - computational cost
Thus, I think the default waypoint follower is fine with `pure_pursuit` for Autoware. 
3. ok, I'll add how to test with rosbag later. (I didn't write it because rosbag test can not check how the vehicle moves with the control command generated by MPC. The rosbag test can only check if the command is published properly)

@TakaHoribe actually I think that is one big problem at the moment, there are loads of re-implementation of basic mathematical functions everywhere within the code base, which actually increases maintainability needs instead of having all central within a core library.

Advantages of constrainted optimization is, for example, there is an improvement for the tracking accuracy on a path that can not be followed without turning the steering angle to the maximum. Solvers that know the maximum steering angle may give up the tracking accuracy of a part of the path for global optimum.

For quick reply about test code, what level of test code should we write for these ros node? I talked about this with @gbiggs , and he suggested to write how to use rosbag data for the node in PR, so that reviewer can test the code.
I wrote function test code only for kalman filter library because it is a library.

@sgermanserrano Yes, I have seen some libraries, but I couldn't judge which one should we use soon. Actually, in this kf package, I used only the most basic matrix calculation of Kalman Filter, which is just a few lines, and so I thought scratch would be better in the viewpoint of development and debugging of the first try.
At first, we should make this architecture autowarefoundation/autoware_ai#461 work. We can discuss later about which Bayes algorithm or which library is better.
Of course, I agree to use well-managed open libraries, and we can replace my kf code to other libraries in the future, if it is worth to do so. ",TakaHoribe,5050299.0,208.0,19,41,0,385,8698

Thank you for your advice. 

I used `colcon_release` script because I thought that the script is the replacement of  `catkin_make_release`, which Autoware Build Instruction tells the users to use. 
I thought that this would be the most ""basic"" way to build Autoware(at least for the first time). 
https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki/Source-Build

Also, the error won't be reproduced just by running `colcon build; colcon install` if the user has done `catkin_make` before colcon bulid. The script will make sure that ""devel"" directory is deleted before running colcon build. (Although I think this operations should be removed in `colcon_release` script because the directory is not related to colcon.)

Anyway, you are correct that normal colcon users would be more familiar with your commands, so I just tested with your commands and checked that it works fine. ",mitsudome-r,8959.0,2771.0,6,1,0,1,4

> Most of these are already included in the TF library, boost, and OpenCV.

Some of them are implemented in OpenCV and others, but I think we should proceed with libraries to reduce dependencies using wrappers etc. Functions such as OpenCV are low-level APIs, and there are various common codes to use these things. We need to abstract a little more for Autoware.

And many of them are not implemented in these libraries, and cooperation between libraries reduces the readability of the code.

In Apollo, these libraries are very carefully made and commonly used. Even if I make such a library from now on, nobody uses it, so I think that it should be prepared as soon as possible.

That's not true, for example a quick search reveals that the `numerical_comparisons.hpp` file you added in this pull request, is copied directly from:

You didn't implement that, you just copied it from another project.

No, maintenance becomes difficult when we add more lines of code arbitrarily.

Depending on other libraries not only saves us time in the short term, but also ensures that we don't have to maintain that code ourselves, so we can focus on important stuff.

Thank you.
About Kalman Filter: you are correct. However, the formulas of the Kalman filter are reusable because they can be made generalized kalman filter library. For example, we are currently developing ekf for localization estimation. Here, we have implemented a Kalman filter library that can be used generically. We want to use this library with mot (multi object tracking).
https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/blob/feature/kalman_filter/ros/src/computing/perception/localization/packages/kalman_filter_localizer/include/kalman_filter/kalman_filter.h
Table of sin and cos: Calculation of sin function is expensive because calculation is Taylor expansion. The sin function is very often used in MPC, Particle Filer, Local path palanner, etc. In addition, they generally need to run at high frequency, which makes the computational cost a bottleneck. There is still reasons, in the past experience, this is absolutely necessary.

All the missing packages in Melodic are in https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/tree/feature/melodic/ros/src/vendor. The other thing missing is a PIC-built binary for `libymc_can`, @amc-nu knows more about that.

> Will adding support for Melodic impact building/running on Kinetic in any way?

No. However, we might want to remove or comment out the `jsk_*` packages from Dockerfile so that they don't clash with the ones in `ros/src/vendor`

The roadmap discussion currently aims for repository splitting in 1.12, which would mean pushing merging this further into the 1.12 iteration if we need to split first.

I don't think splitting the repositories precludes adding support for Melodic. However, it may have the benefit of users being able to have the core of Autoware (planning, perception, drivers, etc.) running on Melodic (on a vehicle, for example), while having tools and the visualization plugins still running on Kinetic (on a desktop). Separating the core from the external tools would also make the introduction of Autoware.Auto as a dependency easier, since we can add support for Melodic incrementally (in case there's a problem with the tools or the rviz plugins).",esteve,8087040.0,226.0,30,126,0,135,19965

Many users may end up causing more problems for themselves. Of course, we shouldn't just say ""No GPU for you"" and leave it at that, but we do need to be careful. Here's how we propose to allow the user to enable GPU support but also ensure that they are forced to know at least a little of what they are doing first.

1. Add an option to the relevant packages to enable GPU. Make it off by default. Document that to use GPU you must enable that option in ccmake.
2. If disabled, use CPU and be happy with Ubuntu versions
3. If enabled, look for necessary eigen and CMake versions and break if not found.
4. If those tools are recent enough and CUDA is not found, break.
5. Otherwise, build

Back-porting the change to 3.10 (the version available on Ubuntu 18.04) fixes the issue so I'm seeing if it is something we can fake here. One option would be providing our own FindCUDA.cmake in the appropriate packages (a 3.10 + fix version).

See images
It is the right time to remove the code from the Autoware repo and use the upstream version directly. The change to _driver.cc_ should be pushed upstream and the launch and yaml files can be kept in the Autoware repo if they are Autoware-dependent.

3- change op_library start using the new utility library replacing the old in packages one by one 
3.1 - op_planner -> PR 2 
3.2 - op_ros_helpers & op_simu -> PR 3 
3.3 - op_global _planner -> PR 4 
and so on .. 
what do you think ? 
once PR 1 is approved I will start working on the rest.

This is resolved as per [https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13](https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13)

@esteve the OpenGL support for the CUDA-enabled images is inherited from autowarefoundation/autoware#1416 which in turn was inherited from autowarefoundation/autoware#1167. This contains the $LIB that you mention, by the look of this [this issue](https://github.com/a2o/snoopy/issues/112) it seems that $LIB is meant to be used to support having 32 and 64bit versions of a particular library. I think we are safe to remove those lines (done in [https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13](https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13)).

@hatem-darweesh Would you explain why lidar_kf_contour_track is important for OpenPlanner? In my understanding, OpenPlanner is independent from tracking algorithms, and can use other tracking algorithms.

It'd be great reconcile the different CI systems into one, I believe the best scenario would be to have one single ""source of truth"" that includes all the features of each CI.

We currently have:

- the industrial_ci integration done by @amc-nu 
- @sgermanserrano 's work on GitLab
- the deprecated Travis scripts
- the AutowareAuto CI infrastructure (cc @dejanpan )
- the switch to colcon so we can introduce ROS2 into Autoware.ai

I'd say that adding multiple CI systems would incur in a significant amount of work maintaining so much infrastructure, we should narrow it down to only one that satisfies our requirements.

My takeaways:

- industrial_ci is very mature, but does not support ROS2 yet. We could work on getting colcon used upstream, so that we can support both ROS1 and ROS2.
- The AutowareAuto CI infrastructure uses colcon, this would require https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/pull/1704 to be merged. AutowareAuto also has support for Marv, an online repository for rosbags
- @sgermanserrano first ported the functionality of the legacy Travis scripts to GitLab. And then he extended it (e.g to support code coverage), which was always the plan.
- Some of the benefits of industrial_ci are already in colcon (like checking the install target, test report, etc.)",esteve,261721.0,173809.0,6,21,0,1,129
