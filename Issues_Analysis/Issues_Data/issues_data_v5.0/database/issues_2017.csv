I am working on a solution for that out of memory problem. By dividing the input point cloud into smaller chunks (around 2 millions points per each) and process them one by one, the out of memory problem can be avoided.

example:
1.  the topic messages seems always jump back to re-counter again. it seems the messages is lost when handling mapping.

2. the handling speed is still very slow for tolerance though it is faster than NDT_mapping.  and the cpu resources are not good used when handling, some core is 100%, some core is 0%, even start openMP.

3. during handling process, the map data will lost suddenly and disappear,  and re-produce the map from scratch. this step I tried many times, and almost in every loop will lost data, I think it's easy to re-produce the issue.

[CI] Add Travis CI conf for ROS Kinetic.,2017-11-22T20:58:05Z,276194841,346471082.0,reply,"@130s thanks for the PR. We in fact do not have an internal CI (other than 50+ developers building regularly on their work stations) and that is a major problem indeed which we are aware of.

However the problem is also not to setup a CI script (we could and are trying to do so on ROS buildfarm https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/16449) but we need to make packages releasable as per autowarefoundation/autoware_ai#960 first.
So I would for now not accept this PR as I certainly do not need another CI server screaming at me for something I know very very well that we need to fix.

But I would happily accept help for making the Autoware packages releasable.

That's on my todo stack and requires some more thoughts. I'll probably respond to that question by answering [this thread](https://answers.ros.org/question/273190/ci-recommendation/) or even more particularly, by editing [this wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/CIs). In a nutshell the one provided by `ros.org` is the official so you're definitely encouraged to use that one. But I found that it doesn't cover everything, and requires rather a complicated setting. So usually I recommend using both ros.org and industrial_ci (which I normally do).",130s,14371310.0,1987.0,3,1,0,1,24

I fixed them, added options to runtime manager and pushed, would you please check?

And then, you have to use this correct command for testing with your rosbag, including tf links between **base_link** and velodyne_front/rear.
I already used ApproximateTimePolicy. :)

```sh
roslaunch points_preprocessor points_concat_filter.launch \
  input0:=/front/velodyne_points input1:=/rear/velodyne_points output_frame:=base_link
```

Or please use this runtime_manager like this.

I could not reproduce the problem in the similar environment.(ubuntu 14.04 without GPU Setup)
It seems that code for GPU is added only when CUDA is found.

In some cases, I test only compilation and linking of CUDA code.
In other cases, we can run the nodes you mentioned using only CPU support (extremely slow thought)

I recommend using the *official* installer from NVIDIA https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
Third party repos based setups tend to use older versions and/or mess with driver installations.

I understood about the compilation, thanks.

The result of ""vscan_lidar_tracker"" is shown in this video, the bounding boxes are published in /bounding_boxes_tracked, and using the result of localization recorded in rosbag.
They look noisy because the all detected types of objects is used for tracking, right ?

This PR features a new visual place recognizer which may be useful for initializing localization in other nodes such as NDT (ie. it performs global localization like GPS), only using vision. To be succesful, map of the place with global coordinate is required. This map can be created using orb_mapping node as part of orb_localizer.

TierFusion Driver Updated,2017-07-25T05:48:38Z,244992982,317636190.0,reply,"@shinpei0208 I do not want to disrupt your process but this is how I see a solid, bullet proof yet lean development cycle:

- if you are working on a feature/bug/new-release => create an issue 
- create a branch, work on the feature/bug/new-release, **refer in at least one commit to the issue #Number** 
- open pull request for given feature/bug/new-release but use a pull request template. See:
  - https://gist.github.com/dejanpan/01927c164025b973b54dbe0b490bef65
  - https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates

This would assure that we know where the feature originated from and the implementation would be linked to the feature request (or bug report). Otherwise there is absolutely no tracebility.
Secondly, with the pull request template it will be easier for the reviewer(s) to understand the changes and we can later on convert ""Steps to Reproduce"" into integration tests.

I couldn't add the checkbox to run ros-node in the Map tab, because it is too complicated for me.
And I think it is not so bad because the ""vector_map_server"" is under the ""src/data"" directory.

**PRODUCTION**

## Description
Real-time compressing/decompressing velodyne packet data. Date from HDL64E, HDL64ES2, HDL64ES3, HDL32E and VLP_16 are supported.  Compression ratio is around 1/3. Decompressed points may have a little bias which is less than 1cm.

None.

## Todos
Sorry, I'm not sure about the meaning of Tests and Documentation. I do not cover the test data in the file.

## Steps to Test or Reproduce

Compression:
 Start compression node
`rosrun compression compress2png`
Then play your file which should have /velodyne_packets topic:
`rosbag play yourfile.bag`
Compression node will compress packet data into a new topic /velodyne_packets_compressed
You can use 
`rosbag record /velodyne_packets_compressed`
to get the compressed data.

Decompression:
Start decompression node
`rosrun compression recon2packet`
Then play the compressed data which should have /CompressedPacket topic:
`rosbag play compresseddata.bag`
Then a reconstructed  /velodyne_packets will be built

Workflow of testing:
**Input:**
/points_raw (Velodyne PointCloud)
**Output:**
/points_no_ground (Velodyne PointCloud with Ground Filtered)
/points_ground (Velodyne PointCloud including only the points estimated as ground)

How to run:
1. Play ROSBAG with velodyne sensor data
2. Run velodyne_pointcloud conversion node (if necessary)
3. Run this filter
```rosrun points_preprocessor ground_filter _sensor_model:=X```

Where X might be 16, 32, 64 according to the number of beams of the Velodyne Sensor

If you wish to include Euclidean clustering in the test, set the Euclidean cluster params to:
1. *remove_ground* to False
2. *input_point_clound* to points_no_ground

```
$ rosbag play sample_moriyama_150324.bag
$ rosrun points_preprocessor ground_filter _sensor_model:=32
$ rosrun rviz rviz

Then I added blue point cloud as ground and red point cloud as non ground. From the attached screenshot you will see that blue point reach densely up to 0.5m above the ground and some sparse blue points are also way above the ground. So I'd conclude that the algorithm doesn't quite work correctly yet.

I met compiling error when I tried to compile latest `develop` branch.
The brief error was followings:

As I found that `<<` operator in `ROS_ERROR_STREAM` doesn't seem to be able to use with ifstream,
I made some modifications to fix this compile error.

https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/commits/feature/kinetic
in this branch, the dependencies between packages are not defined correctly and I cannot compile all packages correctly.
anyways, i guess i can merge my branch into yours.

IMO, msg files should be separated from some specific packages, [here](http://answers.ros.org/question/82711/separate-package-for-messages/) is the discussion on that topic.  
official packages such as std_msgs, sensor_msgs, etc. are maintained as I mentioned.

```add_definition(xxx yyy_generate_messages_cpp) ``` line to ```add_dependencies(xxx ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})```.",ompugao,314959.0,14450.0,7,2,0,180,2060
