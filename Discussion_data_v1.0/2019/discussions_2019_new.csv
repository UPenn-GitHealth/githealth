ndt_slam,2019-05-30T03:53:16Z,52,10,questioned,"@javcursor Hi,

> There are some guide to correctly configure parameters?

The parameter description is written in readme (ros / src / computing / perception / localization / packages / lidar_localizer / nodes / ndt_slam / README.md).
But I do not write how to configure them.

> What Lidar is used in this video?

Velodyne HDL-32e.

Thank you for sending rosbag.
I tried several times, but the mapping  is quite difficult because there is a timing that only one pole is visible.

As a solution
・ (Recommended) Use VLP-32c etc.
VLP-32c can be seen up to 200m. So it can see the building even from the end of the circuit.
・Fusion Odometry, IMU, GNSS with EKF. We are developing this feature.

Also, this is a hack method, but you can temporarily stop the mapping and skip the locations where localization is lost, as shown below.
1. Mapping until just before localization is lost
1. pause the rosbag
1. kill ndt_slam and save the map
1. publish the map saved from Map tab of RuntimeManager
1. launch ndt_slam with `With Mapping` turned off
1. play rosbag until you can see buildings around.
1. Align self-position with 2D Pose Estimate.
1. After confirming that the self position is stable, set `With Mapping` to ON.

For your refarence, the best parameter I configured.(Note: Position estimation is lost on the way)

Thanks!",amc-nu
MPC waypoints follower,2019-05-20T05:04:52Z,80,9,questioned,"@amc-nu Answers to your question are

1.  The `mpc_follower` can use more information to follow waypoints, which enables to follow waypoints accurately. The features of the two followers are
 - `pure_pursuit` plans to move towards the **one lookahead waypoint**, assuming that **the route has constant curvature** and **angular velocity can be realized ideally**.  
 -  `mpc_follower` plans considering with **all points on the path** and **vehicle dynamics (such as steering delay)** to follow the waypoints.
2. MPC performs better when you want to drive at **complex route with low tracking error** (where the assumption of ""route has constant curvature"" is not apprpriate). While, the drawbacks of MPC are
 -  the difficulty of parameter tuning (it requires knowledge of control theory and vehicle dynamics).

Thus, I think the default waypoint follower is fine with `pure_pursuit` for Autoware. 
3. ok, I'll add how to test with rosbag later. (I didn't write it because rosbag test can not check how the vehicle moves with the control command generated by MPC. The rosbag test can only check if the command is published properly)

@TakaHoribe actually I think that is one big problem at the moment, there are loads of re-implementation of basic mathematical functions everywhere within the code base, which actually increases maintainability needs instead of having all central within a core library. I'd suggest adding `amathutils` as a dependency so we can keep track of all these common functions",sgermanserrano

MPC waypoints follower,2019-05-30T11:37:02Z,80,23,questioned,"@sgermanserrano The qpOASES is for  **constrainted** optimization probem, so the MPC can calculate a control command with considering stering limit or lateral acceleration limit. While the currently used solver (based on Eigen) is just for **unconstraint** optimization problem (just least square optimization). 

Advantages of constrainted optimization is, for example, there is an improvement for the tracking accuracy on a path that can not be followed without turning the steering angle to the maximum. Solvers that know the maximum steering angle may give up the tracking accuracy of a part of the path for global optimum. On the other hand, if the solver doesn't know the maximum steering angle, it calculates the control command for perfect tracking which is actually infeasible due to the steering limit, and lose global optimality as a result.",TakaHoribe

There are several reasons we would like to be able to have these available on the ROS build farm:

1. We are creating packages internally that depend on these messages and we (and our customers) would like to not have to clone these from source every time.
2. In order to release any other packages to the build farm which rely on these messages, the messages themselves must first be available on the build farm.
3. We run CI on all of our packages. Cloning this repo and building all the packages in it from source adds 45 seconds + to each build of each package that relies on them. Seems trivial but CI build time costs money.",JWhitleyWork

@sgermanserrano Yes, I have seen some libraries, but I couldn't judge which one should we use soon.

At first, we should make this architecture autowarefoundation/autoware_ai#461 work. We can discuss later about which Bayes algorithm or which library is better.

Thank you for your advice. 

I used `colcon_release` script because I thought that the script is the replacement of  `catkin_make_release`, which Autoware Build Instruction tells the users to use. 
I thought that this would be the most ""basic"" way to build Autoware(at least for the first time). 
https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki/Source-Build

Also, the error won't be reproduced just by running `colcon build; colcon install` if the user has done `catkin_make` before colcon bulid. The script will make sure that ""devel"" directory is deleted before running colcon build. (Although I think this operations should be removed in `colcon_release` script because the directory is not related to colcon.)

Anyway, you are correct that normal colcon users would be more familiar with your commands, so I just tested with your commands and checked that it works fine. ",mitsudome-r

_setup.bash_ will also source the parent workspace, /opt/ros/DISTRO, while this would not lead to compatibility problems at the moment, I believe it might lead to issues down the line when .Auto is also part of .Ai since /opt/ros2/DISTRO will also be sourced.

Some of them are implemented in OpenCV and others, but I think we should proceed with libraries to reduce dependencies using wrappers etc. Functions such as OpenCV are low-level APIs, and there are various common codes to use these things. We need to abstract a little more for Autoware.

And many of them are not implemented in these libraries, and cooperation between libraries reduces the readability of the code.

In Apollo, these libraries are very carefully made and commonly used. Even if I make such a library from now on, nobody uses it, so I think that it should be prepared as soon as possible.

You didn't implement that, you just copied it from another project.

No, maintenance becomes difficult when we add more lines of code arbitrarily.

Depending on other libraries not only saves us time in the short term, but also ensures that we don't have to maintain that code ourselves, so we can focus on important stuff.

Thank you.
About Kalman Filter: you are correct. However, the formulas of the Kalman filter are reusable because they can be made generalized kalman filter library. For example, we are currently developing ekf for localization estimation. Here, we have implemented a Kalman filter library that can be used generically. We want to use this library with mot (multi object tracking).

Table of sin and cos: Calculation of sin function is expensive because calculation is Taylor expansion. The sin function is very often used in MPC, Particle Filer, Local path palanner, etc. In addition, they generally need to run at high frequency, which makes the computational cost a bottleneck. There is still reasons, in the past experience, this is absolutely necessary.

No. However, we might want to remove or comment out the `jsk_*` packages from Dockerfile so that they don't clash with the ones in `ros/src/vendor`

The roadmap discussion currently aims for repository splitting in 1.12, which would mean pushing merging this further into the 1.12 iteration if we need to split first.

I don't think splitting the repositories precludes adding support for Melodic. However, it may have the benefit of users being able to have the core of Autoware (planning, perception, drivers, etc.) running on Melodic (on a vehicle, for example), while having tools and the visualization plugins still running on Kinetic (on a desktop). Separating the core from the external tools would also make the introduction of Autoware.Auto as a dependency easier, since we can add support for Melodic incrementally (in case there's a problem with the tools or the rviz plugins).",esteve

1. Add an option to the relevant packages to enable GPU. Make it off by default. Document that to use GPU you must enable that option in ccmake.

I'm checking to see if there is a simpler solution that we can just apply to our own CMakeLists.txt files.,maximus5684

[DON'T MERGE YET] [Fix] Catching up upstream CPFL/Velodyne,2019-02-06T16:09:25Z,478,2,answered,"@kfunaoka @amc-nu @aohsato the differences between the updated CPFL/velodyne fork that is being used in Autoware and the upstream version of the drivers is limited to a bunch of launch and yaml files and an _if_ statement in _driver.cc_. See images
It is the right time to remove the code from the Autoware repo and use the upstream version directly. The change to _driver.cc_ should be pushed upstream and the launch and yaml files can be kept in the Autoware repo if they are Autoware-dependent.

This is resolved as per [https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13](https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13)

@esteve the OpenGL support for the CUDA-enabled images is inherited from autowarefoundation/autoware#1416 which in turn was inherited from autowarefoundation/autoware#1167. This contains the $LIB that you mention, by the look of this [this issue](https://github.com/a2o/snoopy/issues/112) it seems that $LIB is meant to be used to support having 32 and 64bit versions of a particular library. I think we are safe to remove those lines (done in [https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13](https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13)).

Enable industrial-ci on Travis ,2019-01-07T11:04:50Z,670,4,answered,"@amc-nu this is great, thanks for pushing it. It'd be great reconcile the different CI systems into one, I believe the best scenario would be to have one single ""source of truth"" that includes all the features of each CI.

We currently have:

- the industrial_ci integration done by @amc-nu 
- @sgermanserrano 's work on GitLab
- the deprecated Travis scripts
- the AutowareAuto CI infrastructure (cc @dejanpan )
- the switch to colcon so we can introduce ROS2 into Autoware.ai

I'd say that adding multiple CI systems would incur in a significant amount of work maintaining so much infrastructure, we should narrow it down to only one that satisfies our requirements.

My takeaways:

- industrial_ci is very mature, but does not support ROS2 yet. We could work on getting colcon used upstream, so that we can support both ROS1 and ROS2.
- The AutowareAuto CI infrastructure uses colcon, this would require https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/pull/1704 to be merged. AutowareAuto also has support for Marv, an online repository for rosbags
- @sgermanserrano first ported the functionality of the legacy Travis scripts to GitLab. And then he extended it (e.g to support code coverage), which was always the plan.
- Some of the benefits of industrial_ci are already in colcon (like checking the install target, test report, etc.)",esteve
Enable industrial-ci on Travis ,2019-01-08T05:19:08Z,670,5,answered,"@esteve @sgermanserrano How about merging this pull request? Since current travis script is already obsolete, this pull request might be useful in some situation until GitLab CI supports industrial_ci even if the results of travis might be ignored by developers. Though there are some challenges @esteve listed, this pull request is harmless and valuable for a short time, I think.",kfunaoka
