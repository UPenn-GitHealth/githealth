So it can see the building even from the end of the circuit.\r\n\u30fbFusion Odometry, IMU, GNSS with EKF. We are developing this feature.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is a hack method, but you can temporarily stop the mapping and skip the locations where localization is lost, as shown below.\r\n1. Mapping until just before localization is lost\r\n1. pause the rosbag\r\n1. kill ndt_slam and save the map\r\n1. publish the map saved from Map tab of RuntimeManager\r\n1. launch ndt_slam with `With Mapping` turned off\r\n1. play rosbag until you can see buildings around.\r\n1. Align self-position with 2D Pose Estimate.\r\n1. After confirming that the self position is stable, set `With Mapping` to ON.\r\n\r\nFor your refarence, the best parameter I configured.(Note: Position estimation is lost on the way)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-30 12-10-49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13819566/58606494-97a07b80-82d6-11e9-93bf-7fd7273d9d9d.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-30 12-12-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13819566/58606510-a8e98800-82d6-11e9-8e69-060b60839cfa.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-30 12-11-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13819566/58606504-9f602000-82d6-11e9-8eae-bd5c97daeaf1.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-30 12-14-55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13819566/58606520-ae46d280-82d6-11e9-9835-9fea0a394dd0.png)\r\n`Input Topics: [/points_no_ground,/filtered_points]`\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-30 12-11-42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13819566/58606521-b43cb380-82d6-11e9-8725-954af2f164fa.png)\r\n\r\n"

The features of the two followers are\r\n - `pure_pursuit` plans to move towards the **one lookahead waypoint**, assuming that **the route has constant curvature** and **angular velocity can be realized ideally**.  \r\n -  `mpc_follower` plans considering with **all points on the path** and **vehicle dynamics (such as steering delay)** to follow the waypoints.\r\n2. MPC performs better when you want to drive at **complex route with low tracking error** (where the assumption of \"route has constant curvature\" is not apprpriate). While, the drawbacks of MPC are\r\n -  the difficulty of parameter tuning (it requires knowledge of control theory and vehicle dynamics). \r\n - computational cost\r\nThus, I think the default waypoint follower is fine with `pure_pursuit` for Autoware. \r\n3. ok, I'll add how to test with rosbag later. (I didn't write it because rosbag test can not check how the vehicle moves with the control command generated by MPC. The rosbag test can only check if the command is published properly)\r\n\r\n"

Solvers that know the maximum steering angle may give up the tracking accuracy of a part of the path for global optimum. On the other hand, if the solver doesn't know the maximum steering angle, it calculates the control command for perfect tracking which is actually infeasible due to the steering limit, and lose global optimality as a result."

We are creating packages internally that depend on these messages and we (and our customers) would like to not have to clone these from source every time.\r\n2. In order to release any other packages to the build farm which rely on these messages, the messages themselves must first be available on the build farm.\r\n3. We run CI on all of our packages.

Create branches from master for your proposed changes.\r\n1. Create PRs from your branches to the master branch in your fork.\r\n1. Comment here with the location of those PRs so everyone can look at them and review them.\r\n1. As each gets declared acceptable, merge it into the master of your fork.\r\n1. When they are all done, rebase to the latest master from the upstream repository and do a PR to the master branch of the upstream repository.\r\n1.

Here's how we propose to allow the user to enable GPU support but also ensure that they are forced to know at least a little of what they are doing first.\r\n\r\n1. Add an option to the relevant packages to enable GPU. Make it off by default. Document that to use GPU you must enable that option in ccmake.\r\n2. If disabled, use CPU and be happy with Ubuntu versions\r\n3. If enabled, look for necessary eigen and CMake versions and break if not found.\r\n4. If those tools are recent enough and CUDA is not found, break.\r\n5. Otherwise, build\r\n\r\nDoes this sound reasonable to you?"

I would suggest adding `--rm` to the `docker build` in the scripts.\r\n> \r\nAdded in [https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13](https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13)\r\n>     3. After pulling the branch and running `./run.sh` I get a message telling me the image ` autoware/autoware:latest-kinetic-cuda` is not available. Do you plan to upload it to docker hub before or after merging this PR?\r\n> \r\nI have pushed the missing images to Dockerhub. I have built the base images using a checkout of tag 1.10.0 and pulled and re-tagged the already available _1.10.0-kinetic_ with the new naming structures so that the previous ones are not overwritten\r\n>     4. I'm getting an error when building the CUDA version. `liblibdpm_ttic.so: undefined reference to 'cuMemFree_v2'` (Plus other undefined references when linking that same file). I think this PR might be missing autowarefoundation/autoware#2000 . Can you confirm? If that's the case, it will be fixed after merging, so please ignore this point.\r\n> \r\nI can confirm that autowarefoundation/autoware#2000 solves it. @filiperinaldi will rebase the current _develop_ to get the latest update\r\n>     5. CPU version builds flawlessly. However, seems it still doesn't contain autowarefoundation/autoware#1861 autowarefoundation/autoware#1990 it is also pointing to `devel` space. I wasn't able to run anything inside the container.\r\n> \r\n> \r\nThis is resolved as per [https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13](https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13)\r\n\r\n@esteve the OpenGL support for the CUDA-enabled images is inherited from autowarefoundation/autoware#1416 which in turn was inherited from autowarefoundation/autoware#1167. This contains the $LIB that you mention, by the look of this [this issue](https://github.com/a2o/snoopy/issues/112) it seems that $LIB is meant to be used to support having 32 and 64bit versions of a particular library. I think we are safe to remove those lines (done in [https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13](https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13)).\r\n\r\n"

It'd be great reconcile the different CI systems into one, I believe the best scenario would be to have one single \"source of truth\" that includes all the features of each CI.\r\n\r\nWe currently have:\r\n\r\n- the industrial_ci integration done by @amc-nu \r\n- @sgermanserrano 's work on GitLab\r\n- the deprecated Travis scripts\r\n- the AutowareAuto CI infrastructure (cc @dejanpan )\r\n- the switch to colcon so we can introduce ROS2 into Autoware.ai\r\n\r\nI'd say that adding multiple CI systems would incur in a significant amount of work maintaining so much infrastructure, we should narrow it down to only one that satisfies our requirements.\r\n\r\nMy takeaways:\r\n\r\n- industrial_ci is very mature, but does not support ROS2 yet. We could work on getting colcon used upstream, so that we can support both ROS1 and ROS2.\r\n- The AutowareAuto CI infrastructure uses colcon, this would require https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/pull/1704 to be merged. AutowareAuto also has support for Marv, an online repository for rosbags\r\n- @sgermanserrano first ported the functionality of the legacy Travis scripts to GitLab. And then he extended it (e.g to support code coverage), which was always the plan.\r\n- Some of the benefits of industrial_ci are already in colcon (like checking the install target, test report, etc.)"
