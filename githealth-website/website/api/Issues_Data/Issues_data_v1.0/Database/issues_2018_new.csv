Refactor OpenPlanner code following ROS C++ code style ,2019-01-04T17:32:55Z,10,1,answered,"@hatem-darweesh this looks great, thanks for taking the time to flesh out the code. Did you use `clang-format`? Dave Coleman put up this `clang-format` configuration file that matches the ROS1 C++ code style:

https://github.com/davetcoleman/roscpp_code_format

In addition to that, ROS2 also has a configuration file for `uncrustify` with the ROS2 code style (the ROS1 code style guide will eventually converge with ROS2's):

https://github.com/ament/ament_lint/blob/master/ament_uncrustify/ament_uncrustify/configuration/ament_code_style.cfg

I'm working on integrating ROS2's build system (ament) with Autoware, which will bring automatic code style checking (in addition to other stuff), you can have a look at it at:

https://github.com/esteve/Autoware/tree/feature/use_ament_vector_map

ament supersedes catkin and does not require ROS2, so we can use it with Autoware and ROS1.

Adding automatic code checking and generating a test report is as simple as adding these two lines:

Eventually all existing code will be ported to ament, so that the migration to ROS2 is easier.

> should I stop refactoring OpenPlanner?

Feel free to keep making changes to OpenPlanner, of course :-) But now that colcon will be part of Autoware 1.10 and ament will be in 1.11, we have the opportunity to add the ament linters to existing packages. However, this shouldn't block you from refactoring OpenPlanner, we can always port it to ament after or during 1.11.

> I am looking forward to use ROS2 with Autoware.

So am I! :-)

> do you recommend to use ROS2 code style from now ?

Both styles are very very very similar, my recommendation is that you continue with the changes you're making and we merge them, and once we have the ament infrastructure in Autoware, we can port OpenPlanner to ament and check if your changes pass the ROS2 checks.

> what is the difference between using ""ament"" and ""colcon"" as build tools ?

Basically, a build system comprises the functions and macros that are added to a build definition to find a package's dependencies (e.g. the build_depend tags in package.xml help rosdep install the dependencies), how to generate messages, etc.

A build tool is the program that knows how to read the metadata (package.xml) and the build definition (CMakeLists.txt) to produce a library or an executable.

Back in ROS1, the build system and the build tool were the same: catkin. catkin_make could only build catkin packages. In ROS2, we introduced ament, the evolution of the catkin build system, and had to create ament_tools to support the ament build system.

But that was just too messy, because now you needed a different tool for a different build system, and to solve that, colcon was created. colcon understands packages that are written for the catkin (ROS1), ament (ROS2), CMake, setuptools (Python), Gradle (Java), etc. build systems, so we can now use the same tool for building workspaces that contain packages for different build systems.

This is a huge benefit for us, because we can have code written for ROS1 that use the catkin build system, but also ROS1 packages with the ROS2 build system (ament), and packages entirely written for ROS2 all in the same workspace. So instead of rewriting Autoware entirely for ROS2, we can do it step by step: first convert the build system of some of the packages to ament, add the ros1_bridge, add new packages that use ROS2, etc.

The link I pasted before is just an example of a ROS1 package, ported to ament and showing how the ament linters help keeping the code clean.",esteve

However, you are right about not getting the friend privelages.

Using the approach of breaking the rosbag API is nasty and introduces maintainability issues. Here's what I think you should do:

- Since this is not going into 1.11, you need to make a fork and do a new PR from there anyway.
- In your fork, make one branch for each tool you are proposing so we can deal with each one individually.
- For the tool using rosbag, make the necessary changes in the rosbag API so you don't need to circumvent it. Propose them in a PR to the rosbag repository.
- Submit your tool as-is, but also submit a feature request to change it to use the changed rosbag API once that gets released in a ROS version we support (it is possible it would get released in Melodic if it doesn't change how the API is used for any other code).

We can accept the PR for that tool conditional on there being a proposal to change the rosbag API and your tool intending to use it in the future.",gbiggs

Yes, so I renamed `points2costmap` to `points_to_costmap` in this PR's files.
However, it is still confusing to have a similar name on both packages.

Basically, both 2 files do the same thing except that old `points2costmap` is computationally expensive.

So, will propose to make old `points2costmap` obsolete in next release(1.12).

But I think I can use a different distribution name on its first argument and tag name, e.g. `./run.sh indigo -t 1.7.0-kinetic`. How about this?

Would you comment my pull request? I can modify or revert any of the changes in my pull request :)

## Description
- The first arg indigo|kinetic is removed for the inconsistency @aohsato mentioned, i.e., `./run.sh indigo -t 1.7.0-kinetic`
- Set default tag latest-kinetic
- Output image name and shared dir info even if tag and repo are not specified
- Add -h option for help

## Usage
- Option `-h` outputs `Usage: $0 [-t <tag>] [-r <repo>] [-s <Shared directory>]`
- Option `-t` specifies tag (Default: `latest-kinetic`)
- Option `-r` specifies repo (Default: `autoware/autoware`)
- Option `-s` specifies shared dir (Default: `/home/$USER/shared_dir`)
- `./run.sh` outputs `Using autoware/autoware:latest-kinetic` and `Shared directory: /home/$USER/shared_dir` even if tag and repo are not specified",kfunaoka

I randomly and briefly looked at this PR and I just can't help myself but to comment:
1. Why are there 83 files changed?
1. Why are there changes in more than 10 different packages?
1. Why do you do refactoring and functional changes in 1 PR? Why don't you separate this?
1. Why don't you document?
1. Which coding style do you use? e.g. some function names are in all capital letters.
1. Why are there no tests? There are some tests amathutils but changes to this library not even belong in the scope of this PR, right?
1. How will you make sure that this does not break everything in Autoware since it is such a fundamental change?
1. Did you check if you have any unused or uninitialized variables?
1. Are you checking return types everywhere?
1. You state: ""I redesigned the state transition and divided it into three state machines Vehicle, Mission, Drive. The details are as follows."" => these are no details, these are just some bubbles and some arrows. Can you please create a proper design document and document this new FSM design and how is it supposed to be used?
1. Can you list the test coverage for this code? @sgermanserrano knows how to


These above are some basic software engineering practices. Please do refactor and make the code better.

Could you please the following support?
- to remove clang-format commit for another packages
- to check code by cppcheck
- to create readme and overview documents
- to do enrich autowarefoundation/autoware_ai#252 

I think to clear for 1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10 comments.
**Also, we need to add unit test codes.**

> 7. How will you make sure that this does not break everything in Autoware since it is such a fundamental change?

This proposal(#1434) was submitted in August. 
But nobody has proposed any problems, any comments. 
So, we judged that there was no problem even if we replaced it.
In addition, the operation confirmation by the Integration test has been ongoing for a long time now.
Also, we can not continue to support current decision maker, because we have not used current decision_maker since six months ago and we will not use it from now on.

2) Is it not required to use either vector map and waypoint saver methods?

3) Is it the finall output that we set up a goal wherever on the free areas on the grid map and it will publish a global path and a velocity to the robot until it reaches the goal? Just like a normal 2D slam on ROS Navigation stack, we dont need to create a lane on vector map.

Dear mouryaraj:
Yes, the ids will be stable.

We should associate the new detections to the current tracked objects.
In the original code, the order is reversed.

On the other hand, we shouldn't update Kalman Filter with predicted value.
We predict first, then associate the new detection, and finally update Kalman Filter.

I have not yet experienced errors related to the network. The failed jobs were tied to bugs on the gitlab-ci files.

- > How long does the current tests (build & run_tests) takes? It seems there are one and half hour (1:23:18) and more than two hours (02:15:58). Does the difference between one and half hour and more than two hours seem to come from GitLab server load (or difference of test contents)? I think deep investigation is not necessary :)

I'm not sure how the time shown in the pipelines is calculated. If you go inside the pipelines [02:15:58](https://gitlab.com/ServandoGS/Autoware/pipelines/31993443/builds) & [1:23:18](https://gitlab.com/ServandoGS/Autoware/pipelines/32012833/builds), each job has taken less than 1h30min.

tx2docker,2019-03-30T10:23:34Z,387,9,answered,"@Squigglywave 

I tested on tx2 in the initial state.

At first, when Docker ran with the host clean, almost nothing was started. It seemed to depend on the host, so next I installed ros-kinetic-desktop-full on the host. Then Runtime Manager and Rviz ran in container ,but gazebo doesn’t run.

I checked Host-container libraries.
“txdocker” line 28 and line 45, this is added to the Docker run option.
```
-v /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu:/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu
```
GPU libraries is brought from the host.
However, this is  also overwritten the libraries  except GPU.
Therefore, container Libraries disappears, and Libraries which does not exist in the host seems to not work on Docker.

It seems to depend more on the host environment, so I need more information on what to install on the host tx2 to continue testing.
I installed on the host
```
Webpack 3.2.1
docker-ce
ros-kinetic-desktop-full
```
Could you tell me what to install on the host?",sousou1

Thank you !
The test went well except for one point. It seems that GPU is also usable.

There was one error.
In launch  localization,
```No such file /home/autoware/Autoware/ros/install/runtime_manager/share/runtime_manager/scripts/setup_tf.launch```
so
I have copied file from ```/home/autoware/Autoware/ros/src/utill/packages/runtime_manager/scripts/```
After this work, I was able launch localization.
Did you get this error?


In addition, I may want you to confirm two points.


• It is too dependent on the host, especially the ROS part. 
An optional docker run, -v /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu: /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu
Because of this, the library of ROS in docker has disappeared. Can not run ROS in docker without erasing? (It is desirable to run even if ROS is not installed on the host)

• Build on tx2  takes time. Can I bring a docker image built on a PC to tx2? I thought it would be nice to be like docker hub in the future.",sousou1
tx2docker,2019-04-11T00:50:55Z,387,15,questioned,"@sousou1 Hello again! 
- Thanks for pointing out the one line in txdocker. It turns out after building it and running it without that line Autoware works fine for me. I was able to access the GPU resources and ROS was running without it installed on the host.

Please be aware: This repository (previously platform_automation_msgs) and the packages under it are changing names. This was necessary to make the package names less generic and was required by the OSRF guys before the packages could be released into the build farm. These changes are covered in astuff/automotive_autonomy_msgs#8.

Looking at Autoware, the package module_comm_msgs was the only package used by that project which contained messages in this repo. The two messages that were used - SteerMode and SpeedMode - will now live under automotive_platform_msgs and this will need to be changed in Autoware to use the apt installs.

Note: This should not cause any changes with the current version of Autoware because the submodule is tied to a specific commit and a clone request for the previous repo name will redirect.",JWhitleyWork

@kfunaoka unfortunately `travis_wait` only helps if the code in `.travis.yml` is actually run, but in many cases Travis doesn't start a worker and the build time outs, causing it to fail. The only thing that can be done in that case is to just trigger a new build.",esteve

- generic-aarch64, for any aarch64-running board

Builds on Travis right now take over 40 minutes, so if they also run the tests it's quite likely that they'll reach the 50 minute limit for public projects (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#build-timeouts).

> @esteve were you able to test this on any of arm machines (e.g. drivePX2?).

Yes, though there's a couple fixups that need to be applied after compiling Autoware so that the paths make sense when running on the DrivePX. Unfortunately ROS workspaces are not easily relocatable, but a bit of `sed` fixes that:

`find devel/ -type f -exec grep -Iq . {} \; -and -exec sed -i -e 's#/sysroot/aarch64##g' {} \;`

The following line is needed if the Autoware workspace is exported to the Docker container as a volume with a different path other than the one in the DrivePX (e.g. `/home/nvidia/Autoware`):

`find devel/ -type f -exec grep -Iq . {} \; -and -exec sed -i -e 's#PATH_ON_THE_HOST#/home/nvidia/Autoware#g' {} \;`

> @esteve just one Q - what would need to happen for this PR to also work the nvidia docker as e.g. in here: #1167?

I'm working on that, but I wanted to get this first up for review. Here's what I'm doing now:

- add the `x86_64` CUDA APT repository to the `sysroot` stage Docker
- install the `cuda-*-cross-aarch64*` packages. Even if these packages are in the `x86_64` repository, they're actually targeting `arm64`. There are some packages (e.g. `cuda-license*`) that target the incorrect architecture (`all` instead of `x86_64`)
- copy the libraries and configuration files from the `sysroot` intermediate stage to `/sysroot/aarch64` in the builder stage.

I'm also trying to figure out how to this all without all the `sed` stuff, but I've given that a lower priority, as I wanted to have something working now that could be iterated from.",esteve

At 68e4b39, the following error occurs.
```

Thanks for your great works.
I'm one of the developer who contributed to implement `dpm_ttic`.

Regarding to
> `1. FLOAT = abs(FLOAT) doesn't really makes sense. Hence remove that.`

As the `thresh` is signed value, I think removing `abs` can leads to collapsing.
I suggest using `std::abs` because it has template declaration.
(Actually, `FLOAT` can be `float` or `double`. It is switched inside `Autoware/ros/src/computing/perception/detection/lib/image/dpm_ttic/cpu/switch_float.h` )

For this, I think I need bag files containing can_info (CAN messages).
I've recorded many bag files which normally include images (from a camera), pointcloud (with a LiDAR) and nmea sentences (by a GNSS); however, they've never had CAN messages yet.
I have my own test vehicle as large as ZMP RoboCar MV2, whose internal communications are all done via CAN.
Would you introduce how to record CAN messages (along with other signals from other sensors)?
FYI, I have the KVASER Leaf as a CAN interface.

Feature/add vehicle status,2018-06-18T07:52:42Z,747,8,answered,"Hi, 
You need to convert CAN messages to autoware_msgs::can_info by yourself. Autoware does not have any function for the converting.

If you successfully convert and publish them, you can record the can_info topic.",k0suke-murakami
Feature/add vehicle status,2018-06-18T10:33:53Z,747,9,answered,"Thanks for your reply, @cirpue49 :)
In vehicle_receiver.cpp, can_info topic is being published -
ros::Publisher can_pub = nh.advertise<autoware_msgs::CanInfo>(""can_info"", 100);
It tells the ROS master that a message of type autoware_msgs\CanInfo is being published on the can_info topic.
This is followed by
can_pub.publish(can_msg);
, which is included in getCanValue function.
I'm wondering (in getCanValue function) there is no code written to input some (CAN) values to can_msg, which should be implemented as
can_msg.____ = values;
Instead, there are just
can_msg.header.frame_id = ""/can"";
can_msg.header.stamp = ros::Time::now();
These two are considered very few by comparing with a message of type autoware_msgs\CanInfo; CanInfo.msg contains

* ""Subscribed topics"" and ""Published topics"" titles are incorrect, swap them.

In `nodes/ndt_matching_monitor/ndt_matching_monitor.cpp`
* Perhaps rename `score_threshold_delta` to `score_delta_threshold`. 
* The default value of `score_threshold_delta` (14) is huge even more for a difference (delta), how did you come to that value? From experiments I found a score of under 2 is reasonable, for delta should be even lower.
* In my implementation I kept the average of score values but you are using the score differences `score_delta_`. The instantaneous score difference is prone to simple errors, whereas keeping the average of ""delta"" values (say, over 1 second) is simple to implement and more robust. 
* The combination of  `score_delta_`  and `iteration_count_` as
```c++
if (iteration_count_ < iteration_threshold_warning_ 
    && score_delta_ < score_threshold_delta_)
```

does not warrant accurate NDT error detection. I'm sending several evaluation data over co-sense4 channel for you to see.  
* The `ndt_matching_monitor` should know when to give up: no matter how many times you initialize pose (BTW, `/initialpose` is 2D) NDT won't converge (GNSS denied environment, multipath errors, etc.) `ndt_matching_monitor` should issue some topic telling the vehicle to initiate stop maneuver or the like. However, only the output is the text message `rviz_info_text` in `overlay_info_text_pub_`. Please create some vehicle emergency topic which other programs can see and take action. For instance, publish your `ndt_status_` as a separate topic, adding a corresponding Autoware message type.

You're right there, fixed.

Changed.

> The combination of score_delta_ and iteration_count_ does not warrant accurate NDT error detection.

A statistical analysis indicates that those two features are a good indicator for when NDT is failing.

> The instantaneous score difference is prone to simple errors

Maybe this might be good. I'll evaluate with an averaged delta, instead of an instantaneous check. However, I think that averaging might not detect an accumulated error. I'll test in any case.

> The ndt_matching_monitor should know when to give up: no matter how many times you initialize pose (BTW, /initialpose is 2D) NDT won't converge.

This is already implemented. The monitor won't let NDT to run randomly.

> Please create some vehicle emergency topic which other programs can see and take action.

Adding nvidia-docker v2 support,2018-07-30T14:32:41Z,772,8,answered,"@koenlek Thanks for this contribution!  I've tried it myself and I can confirm that it successfully builds a docker image containing Autoware using nvidia-docker2.

I don't think we should maintain support for nvidia-docker (v1) any more.  All (or at least most) of Nvidia's documentation now refers to version 2. We're just making life harder for ourselves by trying to support multiple setups.  On that basis I would remove the second argument 'nvidia' to the run.sh and build.sh files.

I'm also doubtful that we should be compiling the Autoware source code into the docker image that we build.  In most other projects the docker image only serves to provide a consistent set of dependencies. After that it's common for the build script to mount the code in the newly created image and run build commands.

",bdholt1
Adding nvidia-docker v2 support,2018-08-01T09:09:32Z,772,9,questioned,"@bdholt1, I agree on both that you should ditch nvidia-docker v1 and that it would be better to exclude source code from the docker image. That is how we use docker at our company too.

The docker image should provide you with a development environment in which you can compile the autoware code (i.e. with all compile-time dependencies available). You can also make a runtime image which contains all the compiled software, but I would advice you to look into catkin install targets to make the deployed filesystem cleaner. When using the install targets you specify a file structure which contains only the files that need to be deployed (e.g. the binaries, launch files, param files, but not the src/header files). Just take a look at any official ros package github repo (e.g. https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation) for an example.

Some recommendations:
- figure out catkin install targets, to more cleanly deploy the code.
- consider switching to catkin_tools, rather than catkin_make. In my opinion, it is faster (especially for large catkin workspaces), cleaner, and more user friendly. It is created and maintained by the people behind ROS, but for some odd reason, it was never pushed as the official recommended successor of catkin_make (probably to avoid the migration troubles/frustrations that it would enforce to all ROS users). When switching you probably run into some cmake issues (as catkin_tools has no ""cmake crosstalk"" and thus is a bit more strict on your catkin correctness, i.e. the CMakeLists.xtx and package.xml). With catkin tools, just run `catkin config --install` (somewhat similar to `catkin_make install`) to enable the install space. Note that in ROS2, install targets will become obligatory (the devel workspace disappears in favor of the install workspace)..
- make two images (check e.g. apollo images too https://hub.docker.com/r/apolloauto/apollo/tags/): 
  - `autoware-dev-<version>` -> no code, no actual autoware
  - `autoware-release-<version>` -> containing deployed autoware code (no code, only binaries and ""share"" files like params / launch)
- for each, you need to make an nvidia and a non nvidia version (the patch I provided will make opengl apps such as rviz work for nvidia, but then its broken on intel integrated graphics...). e.g.
  - `autoware-dev-<version>-nvidia` and `autoware-dev-<version>`

We have a check_nvidia bash function that automatically can 'patch' a docker run command to take care, see this example:

```bash
check_nvidia(){
  if nvidia-smi &> /dev/null; then
    export NV_RUN=""--runtime=nvidia""
    export NV_TAG_SUFFIX=""-nvidia""
  else
    export NV_RUN=""""
    export NV_TAG_SUFFIX=""""
  fi
}

- pos_db
libssh2-dev

libglew-dev
- calibration toolkit
nlopt => libnlopt-dev
- lattice_planner

Also,  I got a following error, but this is not a problem.
```
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install

I think it is a bug on the ROS side.
```libxerces-c2-dev``` only exist in trusty (14.04), xenial's package is ```libxerces-c-dev```
https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libdevel/libxerces-c2-dev
But, ```libxerces-c2-dev``` is registered for ubuntu in rodep's yaml. 
https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/base.yaml#L4894
However, since libxerces-c-dev is installed with ros-kinetic-desktop-full dependency, it is OK to build autoware.

Fix queue sizes of pubs/subs for ensuring real-time,2018-01-31T05:05:55Z,857,1,answered,"@aohsato I checked the operation using several detasets. In some environment, the matching failed in this setting. I think this is because queue size of subscriber for /filtered_points is only one. I think default queue size in ndt_matching.launch should be 10 in order to work well in usual environment.",kitsukawa

Fix queue sizes of pubs/subs for ensuring real-time,2018-02-02T07:33:20Z,857,3,answered,"@aohsato 
I agree with setting the default queue size to 1.

The reason why @ kitsukawa failed in matching,
I think that it is because ndt_matching dose not calculate the initial position of the next matching in consideration of pointcloud time stamp.
In the current implementation, it only adds the last moving distance.

https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/blob/60ae5cf04dcc44ed4f6f1d6e339f8b8f5fea86a2/ros/src/computing/perception/localization/packages/ndt_localizer/nodes/ndt_matching/ndt_matching.cpp#L930

So, before merging this PR,
I think that it is necessary to add a function that complements the moving distance from the point cloud time stamp.

[Feature] region tlr mxnet,2018-01-28T09:43:20Z,865,1,questioned,"## Added latch support and threshold score

This can be set from the command line in the parameters section as:
`rosrun road_wizard region_tlr_mxnet _image_raw_topic:=/camera0/image_source _network_definition_file:=/PATH/TO/FILE/network_definition.json _pretrained_model_file:=/PATH/TO/FILE/pretrained_weights.params _use_gpu:=true _score_threshold:=0.95 _change_state_threshold:=5`

Being `score_threshold` default **0.9** and `change_state_threshold` is **2**.

`score_threshold` defines the minimum score to be accepted by the classifier. In the example above the classifier should report at least **0.95**, otherwise, the state returned by the node will be UNDEFINED. 

`change_state_threshold` defines the number of times the classifier should report the **same result** to be accepted as valid. Otherwise, the previous state will be reported, until a valid new result is got.
