全員(弊社含む)に言えるのかもしれないですが, コミットログはより具体的に書いていただけるとよいと思います(コードを変更したとかは見ればわかるので, 特に書く必要はない). バグを直した場合は, こういう場合にバグが発生したので直したとか具体的に書いてあると後からログを見た時にどういう修正をしたかが理解しやすくなります.

例えば  96c3b77ea3bfb83b5bdeb16882b104ffedde22f3 の場合,  `fixed bug of init`とありますが, これだけでは意味を把握することが難しいです.  私自身理解できていないので間違っているかもしれないですが, zero clearしていないので○○な問題が発生していたとか, 最後に `max_y`, `min_y`を `NO_DATA`にリセットしていなかったため xxな問題が起きていた等も記述していただけるとよいかと思います. (後から見た時に同じ問題に気をつけないともなります).

githubを利用しているので issueを立てそこに具体的な問題を書き, `Fix issue #xx`のように書くのでもよいかと思います. (この場合でも具体的にコミットログを書くに越したことはないですが)

updated fusion to optionally read from any points to image projection,2015-09-16T10:13:58Z,106370328,amc-nu,tier4,140696042,answered,"@amc-nu ,
When I specify the /points_image as input of ranging, no detection results appear on viewer.
![rviz_screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3022416/9901954/edb21408-5ca5-11e5-8ada-cc47eb709fa8.png)

I think I have heard that /vscan_image contains some information (about height or something?) that /points_image doesn't while data type are same.
If ranging node uses the information, I think the compatibility between two topics may be lost.

Could you check it in source code?
As I can check the behavior, please notify if you need.

Thank you!

Now this branch's modification looks working well.

Vecta cam driver,2016-05-31T03:38:33Z,157131318,amc-nu,tier4,222585708,answered,"BTW for Autoware developers, there are some deeply nested code in Autoware. Deeply nested code is difficult to read and understand. You can reduce nest for some patterns. Please consider reducing nest when you write deeply nested code(In general, more than 3-4 nested blocks).

For example.

``` c
int ret = some_function(a, b, c);
if (ret < 0) {
   log(""error...."");
} else {
  // success case
}
```

``` c
int ret = some_function(a, b, c);
if (ret < 0) {
   log(""error...."");
   return ret;
}

// success case
```

Other example(conditions in loop)

``` c
while (some_iterations()) {
    int ret = some_function(a, b, c);
    if (ret < 0) {
       log(""error...."");
    } else {
      // success case
    }
}
```

``` c
while (some_iterations()) {
    int ret = some_function(a, b, c);
    if (ret < 0) {
       log(""error...."");
       continue; // or break, return
    }

    // success case
}
```

Please consider

#### Pull Requestの作成
- 必要最小限の変更にする
  - 例えばこの PRは 55ファイルを 52コミットで変更しているが, そこまで必要なのか. (本質的に必要であれば何の問題もない.)
  - (不要である mergeが含まれるため多く見えてしまっている)
  - PRのタイトル以外のことをしていないか.
  - ここまで多いと cherry-pickすることも難しい
  - 多くなる場合は分割できないかの検討. 特に複数のことを実現している場合
- 不要なコミットの削除
  - あとで第三者が `git log`をした場合に有用なもののみ残す
  - 自分のコミットの誤りを修正するコミットは履歴に不要(rebaseで誤り自体をなかったことにする)
  - 誤ってファイルを追加した場合は, 誤ってファイルを追加してしまったこと自体を消す
  - 自分が同一 PR内で追加したバグを修正するバグ等も同様.

現在対応を検討中です. とりあえず起動時に同名プロセスは全部 killするようにはしています.
`run`と同ディレクトリにある `cleanup`スクリプトでも同様のことができます.
(runtime managerの終了時に killさせようにも rootとして動いているので, そこでまたパスワード入力が必要になるなど単純にはいかないところがあります. いい方法がないか検討します.)

2. the handling speed is still very slow for tolerance though it is faster than NDT_mapping.  and the cpu resources are not good used when handling, some core is 100%, some core is 0%, even start openMP.

I found three issues below:

- If the current speed output by the vehicle is not 0.0 when it is stopped, it can not be recovered from the pause
- Sometimes the right / left turn determination does not go well
I could not recognized case which is need to treated as straight but, actually turn right.

[CI] Add Travis CI conf for ROS Kinetic.,2017-11-22T20:58:05Z,276194841,130s,missing,346471082,answered,"@130s thanks for the PR. We in fact do not have an internal CI (other than 50+ developers building regularly on their work stations) and that is a major problem indeed which we are aware of.

However the problem is also not to setup a CI script (we could and are trying to do so on ROS buildfarm https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/16449) but we need to make packages releasable as per autowarefoundation/autoware_ai#960 first.
So I would for now not accept this PR as I certainly do not need another CI server screaming at me for something I know very very well that we need to fix.

But I would happily accept help for making the Autoware packages releasable.

> since I already have you here - can you comment how industrial_ci is different from ROS buildfarm?

That's on my todo stack and requires some more thoughts. I'll probably respond to that question by answering [this thread](https://answers.ros.org/question/273190/ci-recommendation/) or even more particularly, by editing [this wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/CIs). In a nutshell the one provided by `ros.org` is the official so you're definitely encouraged to use that one. But I found that it doesn't cover everything, and requires rather a complicated setting. So usually I recommend using both ros.org and industrial_ci (which I normally do).",130s,missing,14371310,1987,3,1,0,1,24

@aohsato I was able to perform cloud merging. However, I recommend to use `ApproximateTime` instead of `TimeSynchronizer`, the node is **dropping** most of the frames. Leading to a frequency **less than 1 fps**",amc-nu,tier4,935250,5003,10,11,0,7,185

I fixed them, added options to runtime manager and pushed, would you please check?

And then, you have to use this correct command for testing with your rosbag, including tf links between **base_link** and velodyne_front/rear.
I already used ApproximateTimePolicy. :)

```sh
roslaunch points_preprocessor points_concat_filter.launch \
  input0:=/front/velodyne_points input1:=/rear/velodyne_points output_frame:=base_link
```

Or please use this runtime_manager like this.

They look noisy because the all detected types of objects is used for tracking, right ?

TierFusion Driver Updated,2017-07-25T05:48:38Z,244992982,amc-nu,tier4,317636190,answered,"@shinpei0208 I do not want to disrupt your process but this is how I see a solid, bullet proof yet lean development cycle:

- if you are working on a feature/bug/new-release => create an issue 
- create a branch, work on the feature/bug/new-release, **refer in at least one commit to the issue #Number** 
- open pull request for given feature/bug/new-release but use a pull request template. See:
  - https://gist.github.com/dejanpan/01927c164025b973b54dbe0b490bef65
  - https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates

This would assure that we know where the feature originated from and the implementation would be linked to the feature request (or bug report). Otherwise there is absolutely no tracebility.
Secondly, with the pull request template it will be easier for the reviewer(s) to understand the changes and we can later on convert ""Steps to Reproduce"" into integration tests.

I couldn't add the checkbox to run ros-node in the Map tab, because it is too complicated for me.
And I think it is not so bad because the ""vector_map_server"" is under the ""src/data"" directory.

## Description
Real-time compressing/decompressing velodyne packet data. Date from HDL64E, HDL64ES2, HDL64ES3, HDL32E and VLP_16 are supported.  Compression ratio is around 1/3. Decompressed points may have a little bias which is less than 1cm.

## Related PRs
None.

## Todos
Sorry, I'm not sure about the meaning of Tests and Documentation. I do not cover the test data in the file.

## Steps to Test or Reproduce

Compression:
 Start compression node
`rosrun compression compress2png`
Then play your file which should have /velodyne_packets topic:
`rosbag play yourfile.bag`
Compression node will compress packet data into a new topic /velodyne_packets_compressed
You can use 
`rosbag record /velodyne_packets_compressed`
to get the compressed data.

Decompression:
Start decompression node
`rosrun compression recon2packet`
Then play the compressed data which should have /CompressedPacket topic:
`rosbag play compresseddata.bag`
Then a reconstructed  /velodyne_packets will be built

Workflow of testing:
**Input:**
/points_raw (Velodyne PointCloud)
**Output:**
/points_no_ground (Velodyne PointCloud with Ground Filtered)
/points_ground (Velodyne PointCloud including only the points estimated as ground)

How to run:
1. Play ROSBAG with velodyne sensor data
2. Run velodyne_pointcloud conversion node (if necessary)
3. Run this filter
```rosrun points_preprocessor ground_filter _sensor_model:=X```

Where X might be 16, 32, 64 according to the number of beams of the Velodyne Sensor

If you wish to include Euclidean clustering in the test, set the Euclidean cluster params to:
1. *remove_ground* to False
2. *input_point_clound* to points_no_ground

Then I added blue point cloud as ground and red point cloud as non ground. From the attached screenshot you will see that blue point reach densely up to 0.5m above the ground and some sparse blue points are also way above the ground.

https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/commits/feature/kinetic
in this branch, the dependencies between packages are not defined correctly and I cannot compile all packages correctly.
anyways, i guess i can merge my branch into yours.

IMO, msg files should be separated from some specific packages, [here](http://answers.ros.org/question/82711/separate-package-for-messages/) is the discussion on that topic.  
official packages such as std_msgs, sensor_msgs, etc. are maintained as I mentioned.

Did you use `clang-format`? Dave Coleman put up this `clang-format` configuration file that matches the ROS1 C++ code style:

https://github.com/davetcoleman/roscpp_code_format

In addition to that, ROS2 also has a configuration file for `uncrustify` with the ROS2 code style (the ROS1 code style guide will eventually converge with ROS2's):

https://github.com/ament/ament_lint/blob/master/ament_uncrustify/ament_uncrustify/configuration/ament_code_style.cfg

I'm working on integrating ROS2's build system (ament) with Autoware, which will bring automatic code style checking (in addition to other stuff), you can have a look at it at:

https://github.com/esteve/Autoware/tree/feature/use_ament_vector_map

ament supersedes catkin and does not require ROS2, so we can use it with Autoware and ROS1.

Adding automatic code checking and generating a test report is as simple as adding these two lines:

yes, I used clang format. as explained in #1771

Eventually all existing code will be ported to ament, so that the migration to ROS2 is easier.

> should I stop refactoring OpenPlanner?

Feel free to keep making changes to OpenPlanner, of course :-) But now that colcon will be part of Autoware 1.10 and ament will be in 1.11, we have the opportunity to add the ament linters to existing packages. However, this shouldn't block you from refactoring OpenPlanner, we can always port it to ament after or during 1.11.

> I am looking forward to use ROS2 with Autoware.

So am I! :-)

> do you recommend to use ROS2 code style from now ?

Both styles are very very very similar, my recommendation is that you continue with the changes you're making and we merge them, and once we have the ament infrastructure in Autoware, we can port OpenPlanner to ament and check if your changes pass the ROS2 checks.

> what is the difference between using ""ament"" and ""colcon"" as build tools ?

Basically, a build system comprises the functions and macros that are added to a build definition to find a package's dependencies (e.g. the build_depend tags in package.xml help rosdep install the dependencies), how to generate messages, etc.

A build tool is the program that knows how to read the metadata (package.xml) and the build definition (CMakeLists.txt) to produce a library or an executable.

Back in ROS1, the build system and the build tool were the same: catkin. catkin_make could only build catkin packages. In ROS2, we introduced ament, the evolution of the catkin build system, and had to create ament_tools to support the ament build system.

But that was just too messy, because now you needed a different tool for a different build system, and to solve that, colcon was created. colcon understands packages that are written for the catkin (ROS1), ament (ROS2), CMake, setuptools (Python), Gradle (Java), etc. build systems, so we can now use the same tool for building workspaces that contain packages for different build systems.

This is a huge benefit for us, because we can have code written for ROS1 that use the catkin build system, but also ROS1 packages with the ROS2 build system (ament), and packages entirely written for ROS2 all in the same workspace. So instead of rewriting Autoware entirely for ROS2, we can do it step by step: first convert the build system of some of the packages to ament, add the ros1_bridge, add new packages that use ROS2, etc.

The link I pasted before is just an example of a ROS1 package, ported to ament and showing how the ament linters help keeping the code clean.",esteve,tier4,6458423,713325,4,2,0,61,6900

However, you are right about not getting the friend privelages.

Using the approach of breaking the rosbag API is nasty and introduces maintainability issues. Here's what I think you should do:

- Since this is not going into 1.11, you need to make a fork and do a new PR from there anyway.
- In your fork, make one branch for each tool you are proposing so we can deal with each one individually.
- For the tool using rosbag, make the necessary changes in the rosbag API so you don't need to circumvent it. Propose them in a PR to the rosbag repository.
- Submit your tool as-is, but also submit a feature request to change it to use the changed rosbag API once that gets released in a ROS version we support (it is possible it would get released in Melodic if it doesn't change how the API is used for any other code).

We can accept the PR for that tool conditional on there being a proposal to change the rosbag API and your tool intending to use it in the future.",gbiggs,missing,8437450,5430986,15,11,0,25,2188

Yes, so I renamed `points2costmap` to `points_to_costmap` in this PR's files.
However, it is still confusing to have a similar name on both packages.

Basically, both 2 files do the same thing except that old `points2costmap` is computationally expensive.

So, will propose to make old `points2costmap` obsolete in next release(1.12).

## Description
- The first arg indigo|kinetic is removed for the inconsistency @aohsato mentioned, i.e., `./run.sh indigo -t 1.7.0-kinetic`
- Set default tag latest-kinetic
- Output image name and shared dir info even if tag and repo are not specified
- Add -h option for help

## Usage
- Option `-h` outputs `Usage: $0 [-t <tag>] [-r <repo>] [-s <Shared directory>]`
- Option `-t` specifies tag (Default: `latest-kinetic`)
- Option `-r` specifies repo (Default: `autoware/autoware`)

I randomly and briefly looked at this PR and I just can't help myself but to comment:
1. Why are there 83 files changed?
1. Why are there changes in more than 10 different packages?
1. Why do you do refactoring and functional changes in 1 PR? Why don't you separate this?
1. Why don't you document?
1. Which coding style do you use? e.g. some function names are in all capital letters.
1. Why are there no tests? There are some tests amathutils but changes to this library not even belong in the scope of this PR, right?
1. How will you make sure that this does not break everything in Autoware since it is such a fundamental change?
1. Did you check if you have any unused or uninitialized variables?
1. Are you checking return types everywhere?
1. You state: ""I redesigned the state transition and divided it into three state machines Vehicle, Mission, Drive. The details are as follows."" => these are no details, these are just some bubbles and some arrows. Can you please create a proper design document and document this new FSM design and how is it supposed to be used?
1. Can you list the test coverage for this code? @sgermanserrano knows how to


These above are some basic software engineering practices. Please do refactor and make the code better.

Could you please the following support?
- to remove clang-format commit for another packages
- to check code by cppcheck
- to create readme and overview documents
- to do enrich autowarefoundation/autoware_ai#252 

I think to clear for 1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10 comments.
**Also, we need to add unit test codes.**

This proposal(#1434) was submitted in August. 
But nobody has proposed any problems, any comments. 
So, we judged that there was no problem even if we replaced it.
In addition, the operation confirmation by the Integration test has been ongoing for a long time now.
Also, we can not continue to support current decision maker, because we have not used current decision_maker since six months ago and we will not use it from now on.

I've discussed with @shinpei0208 and @gbiggs how we should go. Since all the activities in TierIV depend on this branch, we'd like to minimize the gap between what TierIV is doing and what the community can do.

1) Which branch should I use to perform the astar planner + obstacle avoidance?

2) Is it not required to use either vector map and waypoint saver methods?

3) Is it the finall output that we set up a goal wherever on the free areas on the grid map and it will publish a global path and a velocity to the robot until it reaches the goal? Just like a normal 2D slam on ROS Navigation stack, we dont need to create a lane on vector map.

4) I tried to follow the instructions above but I could not get it working, the astar path wasn't out on Rviz, is that ok that you could upload your testing video on Youtube and share the link here?

Dear mouryaraj:
Yes, the ids will be stable.

We should associate the new detections to the current tracked objects.
In the original code, the order is reversed.

On the other hand, we shouldn't update Kalman Filter with predicted value.
We predict first, then associate the new detection, and finally update Kalman Filter.

I have not yet experienced errors related to the network. The failed jobs were tied to bugs on the gitlab-ci files.

- > How long does the current tests (build & run_tests) takes? It seems there are one and half hour (1:23:18) and more than two hours (02:15:58).

I'm not sure how the time shown in the pipelines is calculated. If you go inside the pipelines [02:15:58](https://gitlab.com/ServandoGS/Autoware/pipelines/31993443/builds) & [1:23:18](https://gitlab.com/ServandoGS/Autoware/pipelines/32012833/builds), each job has taken less than 1h30min.

I tested on tx2 in the initial state.

At first, when Docker ran with the host clean, almost nothing was started. It seemed to depend on the host, so next I installed ros-kinetic-desktop-full on the host. Then Runtime Manager and Rviz ran in container ,but gazebo doesn’t run.

I checked Host-container libraries.
“txdocker” line 28 and line 45, this is added to the Docker run option.
```
-v /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu:/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu
```
GPU libraries is brought from the host.
However, this is  also overwritten the libraries  except GPU.
Therefore, container Libraries disappears, and Libraries which does not exist in the host seems to not work on Docker.

It seems to depend more on the host environment, so I need more information on what to install on the host tx2 to continue testing.
I installed on the host
```
Webpack 3.2.1
docker-ce
ros-kinetic-desktop-full

The test went well except for one point. It seems that GPU is also usable.

There was one error.
In launch  localization,
```No such file /home/autoware/Autoware/ros/install/runtime_manager/share/runtime_manager/scripts/setup_tf.launch```
so
I have copied file from ```/home/autoware/Autoware/ros/src/utill/packages/runtime_manager/scripts/```
After this work, I was able launch localization.
Did you get this error?


In addition, I may want you to confirm two points.


• It is too dependent on the host, especially the ROS part. 
An optional docker run, -v /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu: /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu
Because of this, the library of ROS in docker has disappeared. Can not run ROS in docker without erasing? (It is desirable to run even if ROS is not installed on the host)

• Build on tx2  takes time. Can I bring a docker image built on a PC to tx2? I thought it would be nice to be like docker hub in the future.",sousou1,missing,55667128,2212106,20,12,0,5,360

[fix] Pin platform_automation_msgs submodule,2018-08-09T00:53:33Z,347847321,esteve,tier4,411602025,answered,"@kfunaoka and @esteve - reproducing this message here from astuff/automotive_autonomy_msgs#7 for visibility:

Please be aware: This repository (previously platform_automation_msgs) and the packages under it are changing names. This was necessary to make the package names less generic and was required by the OSRF guys before the packages could be released into the build farm. These changes are covered in astuff/automotive_autonomy_msgs#8.

Looking at Autoware, the package module_comm_msgs was the only package used by that project which contained messages in this repo. The two messages that were used - SteerMode and SpeedMode - will now live under automotive_platform_msgs and this will need to be changed in Autoware to use the apt installs.

Note: This should not cause any changes with the current version of Autoware because the submodule is tied to a specific commit and a clone request for the previous repo name will redirect.",JWhitleyWork,other,140737,93203,3,2,0,2,3

@kfunaoka unfortunately `travis_wait` only helps if the code in `.travis.yml` is actually run, but in many cases Travis doesn't start a worker and the build time outs, causing it to fail.

> @esteve were you able to test this on any of arm machines (e.g. drivePX2?).

Yes, though there's a couple fixups that need to be applied after compiling Autoware so that the paths make sense when running on the DrivePX. Unfortunately ROS workspaces are not easily relocatable, but a bit of `sed` fixes that:

`find devel/ -type f -exec grep -Iq . {} \; -and -exec sed -i -e 's#/sysroot/aarch64##g' {} \;`

The following line is needed if the Autoware workspace is exported to the Docker container as a volume with a different path other than the one in the DrivePX (e.g. `/home/nvidia/Autoware`):

`find devel/ -type f -exec grep -Iq . {} \; -and -exec sed -i -e 's#PATH_ON_THE_HOST#/home/nvidia/Autoware#g' {} \;`

> @esteve just one Q - what would need to happen for this PR to also work the nvidia docker as e.g. in here: #1167?

I'm working on that, but I wanted to get this first up for review. Here's what I'm doing now:

- add the `x86_64` CUDA APT repository to the `sysroot` stage Docker
- install the `cuda-*-cross-aarch64*` packages. Even if these packages are in the `x86_64` repository, they're actually targeting `arm64`. There are some packages (e.g. `cuda-license*`) that target the incorrect architecture (`all` instead of `x86_64`)
- copy the libraries and configuration files from the `sysroot` intermediate stage to `/sysroot/aarch64` in the builder stage.

I'm also trying to figure out how to this all without all the `sed` stuff, but I've given that a lower priority, as I wanted to have something working now that could be iterated from.",esteve,tier4,595171,111,30,16,0,20,426

I made a few changes to the Travis to fetch the image from my Docker Hub and avoid building in place, since it slows down a lot the CI. I created another repository where I build the Docker image separately:

I've also changed the scripts a bit so that the target architecture can be passed as an argument, so adding new targets is much easier. For example, supporting an ARMv7 or ARMv8 board is only a matter of adding two lines to the `build_cross_image.sh` script. The `catkin_make_release_aarch64` can be changed easily as well, but I've left it as is because I didn't want to make it more complex, but I can iterate in a following PR to add support for more boards.",esteve,tier4,595171,111,30,16,0,20,426

However, I think it'd be best to move SickLDRMS to a separate ROS package and use `CFG_EXTRAS` in `catkin_package()` (http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt#catkin_package.28.29) to export any CMake stuff that other downstream packages need.

I'm one of the developer who contributed to implement `dpm_ttic`.

Regarding to

As the `thresh` is signed value, I think removing `abs` can leads to collapsing.
I suggest using `std::abs` because it has template declaration.
(Actually, `FLOAT` can be `float` or `double`. It is switched inside `Autoware/ros/src/computing/perception/detection/lib/image/dpm_ttic/cpu/switch_float.h` )

In vehicle_receiver.cpp, can_info topic is being published -
ros::Publisher can_pub = nh.advertise<autoware_msgs::CanInfo>(""can_info"", 100);
It tells the ROS master that a message of type autoware_msgs\CanInfo is being published on the can_info topic.
This is followed by
can_pub.publish(can_msg);
, which is included in getCanValue function.
I'm wondering (in getCanValue function) there is no code written to input some (CAN) values to can_msg, which should be implemented as
can_msg.____ = values;
Instead, there are just
can_msg.header.frame_id = ""/can"";
can_msg.header.stamp = ros::Time::now();
These two are considered very few by comparing with a message of type autoware_msgs\CanInfo; CanInfo.msg contains

Changed.

A statistical analysis indicates that those two features are a good indicator for when NDT is failing.

> The instantaneous score difference is prone to simple errors

Maybe this might be good. I'll evaluate with an averaged delta, instead of an instantaneous check. However, I think that averaging might not detect an accumulated error. I'll test in any case.

> The ndt_matching_monitor should know when to give up: no matter how many times you initialize pose (BTW, /initialpose is 2D) NDT won't converge.

This is already implemented. The monitor won't let NDT to run randomly.

I don't think we should maintain support for nvidia-docker (v1) any more.  All (or at least most) of Nvidia's documentation now refers to version 2. We're just making life harder for ourselves by trying to support multiple setups.  On that basis I would remove the second argument 'nvidia' to the run.sh and build.sh files.

I'm also doubtful that we should be compiling the Autoware source code into the docker image that we build.  In most other projects the docker image only serves to provide a consistent set of dependencies. After that it's common for the build script to mount the code in the newly created image and run build commands.

Adding nvidia-docker v2 support,2018-08-01T09:09:32Z,306366138,koenlek,missing,409507151,questioned,"@bdholt1, I agree on both that you should ditch nvidia-docker v1 and that it would be better to exclude source code from the docker image. That is how we use docker at our company too.

The docker image should provide you with a development environment in which you can compile the autoware code (i.e. with all compile-time dependencies available). You can also make a runtime image which contains all the compiled software, but I would advice you to look into catkin install targets to make the deployed filesystem cleaner. When using the install targets you specify a file structure which contains only the files that need to be deployed (e.g. the binaries, launch files, param files, but not the src/header files). Just take a look at any official ros package github repo (e.g. https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation) for an example.

Some recommendations:
- figure out catkin install targets, to more cleanly deploy the code.
- consider switching to catkin_tools, rather than catkin_make. In my opinion, it is faster (especially for large catkin workspaces), cleaner, and more user friendly. It is created and maintained by the people behind ROS, but for some odd reason, it was never pushed as the official recommended successor of catkin_make (probably to avoid the migration troubles/frustrations that it would enforce to all ROS users). When switching you probably run into some cmake issues (as catkin_tools has no ""cmake crosstalk"" and thus is a bit more strict on your catkin correctness, i.e. the CMakeLists.xtx and package.xml). With catkin tools, just run `catkin config --install` (somewhat similar to `catkin_make install`) to enable the install space. Note that in ROS2, install targets will become obligatory (the devel workspace disappears in favor of the install workspace)..
- make two images (check e.g. apollo images too https://hub.docker.com/r/apolloauto/apollo/tags/): 
  - `autoware-dev-<version>` -> no code, no actual autoware
  - `autoware-release-<version>` -> containing deployed autoware code (no code, only binaries and ""share"" files like params / launch)
- for each, you need to make an nvidia and a non nvidia version (the patch I provided will make opengl apps such as rviz work for nvidia, but then its broken on intel integrated graphics...). e.g.
  - `autoware-dev-<version>-nvidia` and `autoware-dev-<version>`

We have a check_nvidia bash function that automatically can 'patch' a docker run command to take care, see this example:

```bash
check_nvidia(){
  if nvidia-smi &> /dev/null; then
    export NV_RUN=""--runtime=nvidia""
    export NV_TAG_SUFFIX=""-nvidia""
  else
    export NV_RUN=""""
    export NV_TAG_SUFFIX=""""
  fi
}

Great work!
I tested it on kinetic with 16.04.
I found missing dependencies for some package's ```package.xml``` there are following:
- pos_db
libssh2-dev
- openplanner
libglew-dev
- calibration toolkit
nlopt => libnlopt-dev
- lattice_planner
armadillo

Could you fix it?

Also,  I got a following error, but this is not a problem.
```
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install -y libxerces-c2-dev] failed
  apt: Failed to detect successful installation of [libxerces-c2-dev]
```
I think it is a bug on the ROS side.
```libxerces-c2-dev``` only exist in trusty (14.04), xenial's package is ```libxerces-c-dev```
https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libdevel/libxerces-c2-dev
But, ```libxerces-c2-dev``` is registered for ubuntu in rodep's yaml. 
https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/base.yaml#L4894
However, since libxerces-c-dev is installed with ros-kinetic-desktop-full dependency, it is OK to build autoware.

I agree with setting the default queue size to 1.

The reason why @ kitsukawa failed in matching,
I think that it is because ndt_matching dose not calculate the initial position of the next matching in consideration of pointcloud time stamp.
In the current implementation, it only adds the last moving distance.

https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/blob/60ae5cf04dcc44ed4f6f1d6e339f8b8f5fea86a2/ros/src/computing/perception/localization/packages/ndt_localizer/nodes/ndt_matching/ndt_matching.cpp#L930

So, before merging this PR,
I think that it is necessary to add a function that complements the moving distance from the point cloud time stamp.

This can be set from the command line in the parameters section as:
`rosrun road_wizard region_tlr_mxnet _image_raw_topic:=/camera0/image_source _network_definition_file:=/PATH/TO/FILE/network_definition.json _pretrained_model_file:=/PATH/TO/FILE/pretrained_weights.params _use_gpu:=true _score_threshold:=0.95 _change_state_threshold:=5`

Being `score_threshold` default **0.9** and `change_state_threshold` is **2**.

`score_threshold` defines the minimum score to be accepted by the classifier. In the example above the classifier should report at least **0.95**, otherwise, the state returned by the node will be UNDEFINED. 

`change_state_threshold` defines the number of times the classifier should report the **same result** to be accepted as valid. Otherwise, the previous state will be reported, until a valid new result is got.

> There are some guide to correctly configure parameters?

The parameter description is written in readme (ros / src / computing / perception / localization / packages / lidar_localizer / nodes / ndt_slam / README.md).
But I do not write how to configure them.

> What Lidar is used in this video?

Velodyne HDL-32e.

Thank you for sending rosbag.
I tried several times, but the mapping  is quite difficult because there is a timing that only one pole is visible.

As a solution
・ (Recommended) Use VLP-32c etc.
VLP-32c can be seen up to 200m. So it can see the building even from the end of the circuit.
・Fusion Odometry, IMU, GNSS with EKF. We are developing this feature.

Also, this is a hack method, but you can temporarily stop the mapping and skip the locations where localization is lost, as shown below.
1. Mapping until just before localization is lost
1. pause the rosbag
1. kill ndt_slam and save the map
1. publish the map saved from Map tab of RuntimeManager
1. launch ndt_slam with `With Mapping` turned off
1. play rosbag until you can see buildings around.
1. Align self-position with 2D Pose Estimate.
1. After confirming that the self position is stable, set `With Mapping` to ON.

For your refarence, the best parameter I configured.(Note: Position estimation is lost on the way)

I checked this, and it was because I changed the vehicle position when gazebo simulation was stopped. I'll change figure and also post here for more info.

1.  The `mpc_follower` can use more information to follow waypoints, which enables to follow waypoints accurately. The features of the two followers are
 - `pure_pursuit` plans to move towards the **one lookahead waypoint**, assuming that **the route has constant curvature** and **angular velocity can be realized ideally**.  
 -  `mpc_follower` plans considering with **all points on the path** and **vehicle dynamics (such as steering delay)** to follow the waypoints.
2. MPC performs better when you want to drive at **complex route with low tracking error** (where the assumption of ""route has constant curvature"" is not apprpriate). While, the drawbacks of MPC are
 -  the difficulty of parameter tuning (it requires knowledge of control theory and vehicle dynamics). 
 - computational cost
Thus, I think the default waypoint follower is fine with `pure_pursuit` for Autoware. 
3. ok, I'll add how to test with rosbag later. (I didn't write it because rosbag test can not check how the vehicle moves with the control command generated by MPC. The rosbag test can only check if the command is published properly)

@TakaHoribe actually I think that is one big problem at the moment, there are loads of re-implementation of basic mathematical functions everywhere within the code base, which actually increases maintainability needs instead of having all central within a core library.

Advantages of constrainted optimization is, for example, there is an improvement for the tracking accuracy on a path that can not be followed without turning the steering angle to the maximum. Solvers that know the maximum steering angle may give up the tracking accuracy of a part of the path for global optimum. On the other hand, if the solver doesn't know the maximum steering angle, it calculates the control command for perfect tracking which is actually infeasible due to the steering limit, and lose global optimality as a result.",TakaHoribe,tier4,1790876,802,30,47,0,41,4286

I wrote function test code only for kalman filter library because it is a library.

@sgermanserrano Yes, I have seen some libraries, but I couldn't judge which one should we use soon. Actually, in this kf package, I used only the most basic matrix calculation of Kalman Filter, which is just a few lines, and so I thought scratch would be better in the viewpoint of development and debugging of the first try.
At first, we should make this architecture autowarefoundation/autoware_ai#461 work. We can discuss later about which Bayes algorithm or which library is better.
Of course, I agree to use well-managed open libraries, and we can replace my kf code to other libraries in the future, if it is worth to do so. ",TakaHoribe,tier4,5050299,208,19,41,0,385,8698

They are not Kalman filter. Maybe, there is some misunderstanding. If you are talking about this library level, I could say, I use Eigen library for the kalman filter. 
The last one is the GPV, as discussed above.
I know there is a Kalman filter Class for OpenCV, but I don't think it is the best way to include the huge OpenCV for just only kalman filter algorithm. As I say, the kalman filter algorithm can be written with just a few lines by using Eigen library. I think the maintenance cost is not high.",TakaHoribe,tier4,5050299,208,19,41,0,385,8698

Thank you for your advice. 

I used `colcon_release` script because I thought that the script is the replacement of  `catkin_make_release`, which Autoware Build Instruction tells the users to use. 
I thought that this would be the most ""basic"" way to build Autoware(at least for the first time). 
https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki/Source-Build

Also, the error won't be reproduced just by running `colcon build; colcon install` if the user has done `catkin_make` before colcon bulid. The script will make sure that ""devel"" directory is deleted before running colcon build. (Although I think this operations should be removed in `colcon_release` script because the directory is not related to colcon.)

Anyway, you are correct that normal colcon users would be more familiar with your commands, so I just tested with your commands and checked that it works fine. ",mitsudome-r,tier4,8959,2771,6,1,0,1,4

Some of them are implemented in OpenCV and others, but I think we should proceed with libraries to reduce dependencies using wrappers etc. Functions such as OpenCV are low-level APIs, and there are various common codes to use these things. We need to abstract a little more for Autoware.

And many of them are not implemented in these libraries, and cooperation between libraries reduces the readability of the code.

That's not true, for example a quick search reveals that the `numerical_comparisons.hpp` file you added in this pull request, is copied directly from:

You didn't implement that, you just copied it from another project.

No, maintenance becomes difficult when we add more lines of code arbitrarily.

Depending on other libraries not only saves us time in the short term, but also ensures that we don't have to maintain that code ourselves, so we can focus on important stuff.

Thank you.
About Kalman Filter: you are correct. However, the formulas of the Kalman filter are reusable because they can be made generalized kalman filter library. For example, we are currently developing ekf for localization estimation. Here, we have implemented a Kalman filter library that can be used generically. We want to use this library with mot (multi object tracking).
https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/blob/feature/kalman_filter/ros/src/computing/perception/localization/packages/kalman_filter_localizer/include/kalman_filter/kalman_filter.h
Table of sin and cos: Calculation of sin function is expensive because calculation is Taylor expansion. The sin function is very often used in MPC, Particle Filer, Local path palanner, etc. In addition, they generally need to run at high frequency, which makes the computational cost a bottleneck. There is still reasons, in the past experience, this is absolutely necessary.

All the missing packages in Melodic are in https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/tree/feature/melodic/ros/src/vendor. The other thing missing is a PIC-built binary for `libymc_can`, @amc-nu knows more about that.

No. However, we might want to remove or comment out the `jsk_*` packages from Dockerfile so that they don't clash with the ones in `ros/src/vendor`

The roadmap discussion currently aims for repository splitting in 1.12, which would mean pushing merging this further into the 1.12 iteration if we need to split first.

I don't think splitting the repositories precludes adding support for Melodic. However, it may have the benefit of users being able to have the core of Autoware (planning, perception, drivers, etc.) running on Melodic (on a vehicle, for example), while having tools and the visualization plugins still running on Kinetic (on a desktop). Separating the core from the external tools would also make the introduction of Autoware.Auto as a dependency easier, since we can add support for Melodic incrementally (in case there's a problem with the tools or the rviz plugins).",esteve,tier4,8087040,226,30,126,0,135,19965

Many users may end up causing more problems for themselves. Of course, we shouldn't just say ""No GPU for you"" and leave it at that, but we do need to be careful. Here's how we propose to allow the user to enable GPU support but also ensure that they are forced to know at least a little of what they are doing first.

1. Add an option to the relevant packages to enable GPU. Make it off by default. Document that to use GPU you must enable that option in ccmake.
2. If disabled, use CPU and be happy with Ubuntu versions
3. If enabled, look for necessary eigen and CMake versions and break if not found.
4. If those tools are recent enough and CUDA is not found, break.
5. Otherwise, build

See images
It is the right time to remove the code from the Autoware repo and use the upstream version directly. The change to _driver.cc_ should be pushed upstream and the launch and yaml files can be kept in the Autoware repo if they are Autoware-dependent.

This is resolved as per [https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13](https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13)

@esteve the OpenGL support for the CUDA-enabled images is inherited from autowarefoundation/autoware#1416 which in turn was inherited from autowarefoundation/autoware#1167. This contains the $LIB that you mention, by the look of this [this issue](https://github.com/a2o/snoopy/issues/112) it seems that $LIB is meant to be used to support having 32 and 64bit versions of a particular library. I think we are safe to remove those lines (done in [https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13](https://github.com/filiperinaldi/Autoware/pull/13)).

Change the last part `grep BSD` by `grep -i apache` and there are only 5 packages stating Apache, and from those 5 only one package says ""Apache 2"". There are also some ""TODO"" licenses, 1 ""gpl"" and 1 ""nonstandard"".

@hatem-darweesh Would you explain why lidar_kf_contour_track is important for OpenPlanner? In my understanding, OpenPlanner is independent from tracking algorithms, and can use other tracking algorithms.

Enable industrial-ci on Travis ,2019-01-07T11:04:50Z,396138215,amc-nu,tier4,451900057,answered,"@amc-nu this is great, thanks for pushing it. It'd be great reconcile the different CI systems into one, I believe the best scenario would be to have one single ""source of truth"" that includes all the features of each CI.

We currently have:

- the industrial_ci integration done by @amc-nu 
- @sgermanserrano 's work on GitLab
- the deprecated Travis scripts
- the AutowareAuto CI infrastructure (cc @dejanpan )
- the switch to colcon so we can introduce ROS2 into Autoware.ai

I'd say that adding multiple CI systems would incur in a significant amount of work maintaining so much infrastructure, we should narrow it down to only one that satisfies our requirements.

My takeaways:

- industrial_ci is very mature, but does not support ROS2 yet. We could work on getting colcon used upstream, so that we can support both ROS1 and ROS2.
- The AutowareAuto CI infrastructure uses colcon, this would require https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/pull/1704 to be merged. AutowareAuto also has support for Marv, an online repository for rosbags
- @sgermanserrano first ported the functionality of the legacy Travis scripts to GitLab. And then he extended it (e.g to support code coverage), which was always the plan.
- Some of the benefits of industrial_ci are already in colcon (like checking the install target, test report, etc.)",esteve,tier4,261721,173809,6,21,0,1,129

Currently, the official support for AWSIM is only ROS2 Galactic, Ubuntu20.04.

For Ubuntu 22.04, try work in progress version which includes our individual repos but will be officially supported soon:
Autoware: https://github.com/shmpwk/autoware/tree/humble-awsim-stable
AWSIM: https://github.com/tier4/AWSIM/tree/humble

Try the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/shmpwk/autoware/
cd autoware
git checkout humble-awsim-stable
./setup-dev-env.sh  #*/enter Y and install cuda-Y.
mkdir src
vcs import src < autoware.repos
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
rosdep update
rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-w""
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch autoware_launch e2e_simulator.launch.xml vehicle_model:=sample_vehicle sensor_model:=awsim_sensor_kit map_path:=<your mapfile location>
```

Note that when launching AWSIM, you need its binary. But currently we have only Galactic version of binary.

Considering the following result, the problem is:
- If `python3-openssl` is installed before Ansible, Ansible won't install `cryptography`.
- If `python3-openssl` isn't installed before Ansible, Ansible will install `cryptography`.
  - And if we install `python3-openssl` after that, the APT version of `cryptography` is newly installed and referenced from `pip`, which causes an error.

- Reduce size of `prebuilt` image
  Considering the prebuilt images is for users to try out Autoware quickly, dev environment could be remove from it. 

- Keep current `prebuilt` image and build another `runtime` image
  This allows users to rebuild partial of Autoware, not the whole project using prebuilt image, then runtime image may be provided just for execution. 

The main concept of size reducing:
- Only use runtime libraries for CUDA/TensorRT (This could save ~2.2GB)
- Only copy the `install` folder or maybe also keep `src` folder (This could save up to ~3.3GB)

I've confirmed this behavior. `clang-tidy` didn't raise warnings unless we intentionally add `-system-headers` and `-header-fileter=.*`.
Since it only affects to user code, I think it's acceptable.

> And the google guideline says to use kConstatntName. So is this Autoware's own rule?

Yes. I personally think it's acceptable considering one of the rationales `consistency across languages` in ROS 2 Docs.

As you write [here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/blob/3cae6eca45b36b75c696780e67aabaee05330629/common/autoware_ad_api_specs/include/autoware_ad_api_specs/routing.hpp#L50-L53), it is natural that we use lower_case for `constexpr` variables.

Hi,

The invalid cross device id comes when you update the nvidia drivers within the docker. Because rocker uses the gpu data from the host pc, and the autoware docker uses cuda 10.1 (latest cuda version is 11.7) and needs to be updated, the installer will try to update the driver on the host pc, resulting in invalid cross device id. 

This issue has been solved in another issue. 

I'll attach the docker image that worked for me and the steps.

1. Use this image ghcr.io/autowarefoundation/autoware-universe:galactic-latest-cuda. This image includes cuda 11.6, TensorRT, and CudaDNN.
2. start rocker using this command, ""rocker --nvidia --x11 --user --env NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES="""" -- ghcr.io/autowarefoundation/autoware-universe:galactic-latest-cuda"". This will allow the host gpu to be used in the docker.
3. You need at least 64GB free RAM to colcon build the project. Having less free memory might result in random CPP error. ""colcon build"" will throw error and terminate the build if the pc runs out of memory. The ""Add SWAP memory"" section in the documentation can be used to solve this issue.

Currently, if someone starts from a fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04 and simply follows the Docker installation instruction, the CUDA drivers will be missing.

    bash
```

**My answered questions:**
- Should we put a copy of the `nvidia_icd.json` and the `10_nvidia.json` instead of recommended mounting recommendations?
  - This was also asked by @kenji-miyake and answered by you [in here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/pull/2736/files#discussion_r923171341).
  - I am ok with your reasoning/solution.
- I couldn't find where the `https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/vulkan/raw/dc389b0445c788901fda1d85be96fd1cb9410164/nvidia_icd.json` file was directing to in the [vulkan repository](https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/vulkan) so I was going to ask where it is from.
  - You discussed this [in above here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/pull/2736#discussion_r922863077)
  - I still don't like that we are downloading these files instead of mounting them from the host, because it is not the recommended way.
  - But I understand your concerns for ease of use and simplicity of the implementation. So let's make it like this as long as things work.


**Small question:**
- Why did we not include `nvidia_layers.json` file from [the same readme](https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/vulkan/-/blob/master/README.md#headless-vulkaninfo)? (not that I know what it does🤷‍♂️)",xmfcx,awf,948759,571095,4,1,0,1,6

From [nvidia documentation](https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-aarch64/455.45.01/README/installedcomponents.html):
> An additional Vulkan layer configuration file is installed as /etc/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/nvidia_layers.json. These layers add functionality to the Vulkan loader.

I'm not sure what that implies, but it seems to work fine without it. And I hadn't come across that file before reading the vulkan readme, which is why it isn't part of the commit. We can add it if someone finds a usecase where it is needed.",ambroise-arm,arm,948759,571095,4,1,0,1,6

In order to list the required nodes for the containers, I am trying to use @kenji-miyake -san's tool from https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions/2581

The tool is private for now but I'm working in cooperation with him to resolve some [issues](https://github.com/kenji-miyake/ros_component_diagram_generator/issues/6) on the package.

With the tool, I will hopefully have a list of all the nodes that are launched with the main launch files.

Right now I am trying to use this [build.sh](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/main/docker/build.sh) to build the docker image but every time I tried, I got some connectivity issues and every time I restarted, it failed at some point and takes a very long time to retry.

- We can change the copyright notation to `Copyright yyyy The Autoware Contributors`. if we can agree with the original authors to do so.

Rationale:

- Since we'll clean up the architecture for Autoware Core, we don't have to care about the existing Universe code so much.
- (I guess) We can't change the copyright notations without some agreements with the original authors.

### For all files

Rule:

- Add `SPDX-License-Identifier`.
- Will accept any other proposals in the future.

Rationale:

- SPDX is useful for automatically analyzing licenses.
- Since we are not legal professionals, there are a lot of things we don't know.",kenji-miyake,tier4,4034045,2545,12,0,0,0,0

The ASF uses `Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one

I guess why they do so is because they sign a CLA. (But I'm not sure.)

I feel if we use `The Autoware Foundation` then it seems the AWF has the copyright.
But actually, since we don't use CLA and only use DCO instead, I think the copyright will remain with the original author, so `The Autoware Foundation` isn't correct.",kenji-miyake,tier4,4034045,2545,12,0,0,0,0

 I've tried with Scenario Simulator **master** branch and [embree_vendor](https://github.com/OUXT-Polaris/embree_vendor). It uses embree version 4.2.0 and when I try to do:
 `colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --packages-up-to simple_sensor_simulator`
 
I got following error on compilation:
`error: ‘RTCIntersectContext’ has not been declared`

I also checked with the original Embree version 4.0 changelog and it says:
`RTCIntersectContext is renamed to RTCRayQuery context and most members moved to
    new RTCIntersectArguments and RTCOccludedArguments structures.`
   
So it appears that embree version 4.x is not fit for Scenario simulator. How should I proceed do you have any suggestions ?

These docker images are occupying a lot of space.

They are generated by the runner probably, there are nothing related to them in the .bash_history file.

Then I've proceed to clean them a bit.

Hmm, it's too small... :cry: 
I want at least 30GB of free space, is it possible to extend the storage size of the VM?

Regarding GitHub-hosted runners, I guess it's minimum requirements.

There is also an automated way of doing it using [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator#github-changelog-generator-).
- It generates [CHANGELOG.md files like this](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
- Related Github Action: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/generate-changelog

## Github Releases

- [automatically-generated-release-notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes#creating-automatically-generated-release-notes-for-a-new-release)

## semantic-release

https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#-semantic-release

> semantic-release automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and publishing the package.

## clerk

This is my favorite so far. :sparkling_heart: 

> Clerk ensures that release notes can be generated from PRs by looking for a release note in the PR description. You can add a note to your PR by adding a single line to its description beginning with `notes: `.

- https://github.com/electron/clerk
- https://github.com/apps/release-clerk

**Example Changelog:** https://github.com/electron/electron/releases

**Example PR:** https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/40536

This looks like the best mix of automation and manual provision. The developers don't need to touch the CHANGELOG.md file.

Developers just use the commit messages with the Conventional Commit style as usual and just add Release Notes section for each PR and rest is automated.",xmfcx,awf,,11342,5,0,0,0,0

Also every developer opens up rviz2 many times while developing Autoware. And even small improvements like these can make everyone's experiences much better.

colcon warning when using development docker for 'velodyne_msgs' ,2023-11-15T14:36:48Z,1978264601,felixf4xu,missing,1812653045,answered,"Hello @felixf4xu 

Thanks for reporting this. This is a benign warning, at least for the current state of this project.

## Simple terminology

In ROS, an overlay is a workspace that is built on top of an underlay.
The underlay typically contains packages installed from binary distributions (like the ROS base installations), while the overlay is where you are developing or compiling additional packages.

## What is this warning **not** about?

This warning is not (at least for now) about whether:
- the package will be built or not.
- the package is will be overridden or not.

> ```console
> ~$ colcon build --help
>   --allow-overriding PKG_NAME [PKG_NAME ...]
>                        Allow building packages that exist in underlay workspaces
> ```

The package will be built and prioritized whether this warning shown or not.

**Detailed info about overriding packages with colcon:** https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/overriding-packages.html

Here is an example with and without overriding:

### Without overriding (default)
```console
mfc@mfc-leo:~/projects/autoware$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
mfc@mfc-leo:~/projects/autoware$ colbu --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1  --packages-select  velodyne_msgs
[1.509s] WARNING:colcon.colcon_core.package_selection:Some selected packages are already built in one or more underlay workspaces:
	'velodyne_msgs' is in: /opt/ros/humble
If a package in a merged underlay workspace is overridden and it installs headers, then all packages in the overlay must sort their include directories by workspace order. Failure to do so may result in build failures or undefined behavior at run time.
If the overridden package is used by another package in any underlay, then the overriding package in the overlay must be API and ABI compatible or undefined behavior at run time may occur.

If you understand the risks and want to override a package anyways, add the following to the command line:
	--allow-overriding velodyne_msgs

This may be promoted to an error in a future release of colcon-override-check.
Starting >>> velodyne_msgs
Finished <<< velodyne_msgs [3.23s]

mfc@mfc-leo:~/projects/autoware$ ros2 pkg prefix velodyne_msgs

```

### With overriding

```console
mfc@mfc-leo:~/projects/autoware$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
mfc@mfc-leo:~/projects/autoware$ colcon build --symlink-install  --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1  --packages-select velodyne_msgs --allow-overriding velodyne_msgs

Summary: 1 package finished [1.84s]
mfc@mfc-leo:~/projects/autoware$ source install/setup.bash
mfc@mfc-leo:~/projects/autoware$ ros2 pkg prefix velodyne_msgs
/home/mfc/projects/autoware/install/velodyne_msgs
```

### Analysis

So whether we override or not, `velodyne_msgs` in the local workspace will have higher priority.

There might be problems that might arise that I don't know. But so far I've never had a problem from having a package overridden in the workspace.

## What could go wrong if we do a dangerous override?

Let's say we have the following packages:
**M1**: distributed with ros, underlay package (it's a ros message package)
**M2**: overridden in local workspace, overlay package (it's a ros message package)
**B**: distributed with ros, depends on **M1**
**C**: local package, publishes **M2** message

In the local workspace, if **C** publishes **M2** message, **B** will not be able to subscribe to it. This is because **B** is compiled with **M1** message, and **M1** and **M2** are not compatible.

This is just a simple scenario I've come up with, you can find more details and dangers here:
- https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/overriding-packages.html#override-every-package-that-depends-on-the-one-you-want-to-override

## What is being overridden?

- (underlay) https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/tree/ros2/velodyne_msgs
- (overlay) https://github.com/tier4/nebula/tree/main/nebula_messages/velodyne_msgs

These are identical.

@drwnz why did you not use the upstream binary package for this?

## Steps to take

- Maybe we can write a short explanation for this on the documentation.
- We could remove the package from the nebula driver. (since they are identical).
- We could use a different name for the nebula driver package.",xmfcx,awf,885199,814080,2,0,0,0,0

Only changed the dependencies.

For Jetson devices, I assume they won't install CUDA separately since it would come with the JetPack.

And even looking at the changes here, as long as it is CUDA 12, they seem to be playing well with each other.
So keeping it same shouldn't be a problem.

That's good to know, so technically setting `cuda_version` to `12.2` wouldn't interfere with any CUDA applications in Autoware.

We wouldn't install the driver on the Jetson platforms, but we would deploy CUDA capable containers on it. The driver is backwards compatible, i.e., you can run CUDA 12.1 on the 12.2 driver. Doing it the other way around can lead to complications.

Yes, I do think we should downgrade to `12.2` but only if we don't explicitly are using any features from `12.3`. This should simplify deployment on the Jetson platforms.

I know it's a bit un-intuitive but when creating a new PR, you should click on ""Small change"" or ""Standard change"" and fill in the information.
More info can be found in here: https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/contributing/pull-request-guidelines/#example

I've pasted in the small change option and edited your PR, you don't need to do this anymore for this PR.
You can edit the description now.

But I come to a conclusion that it will work for the first time and if user will update models manually one by one and will keep engines in the folders and run chechsum it can be confusing. After initial run of autoware user will have some additional files like trt engines. 
Here is the example for lidar_centerpoint.

Do you think it will be better to push user to update all artifacts simultaneously? If so we will need to add a new playbook to ansible and modify setup-dev-env.sh or provide separate script for updating.

Clean unused dependencies to improve build time,2023-04-28T09:59:25Z,1688146132,VRichardJP,macnica,1527304992,questioned,"@simon-t4 This is just a PoC script. By default, I just look for any `#include <dep_name/.*>` in the C/C++ source files. But as you can see, there are quite a few listed ""exceptions"" (and I may have missed a few). Most exceptions are system libraries (e.g. `libboost-dev` -> `#include <boost/.*>`), but there are also ""special"" dependencies that won't be used in the source code (e.g. `rosidl_default_generators` brings cmake macros). It is not difficult to add more cases/exceptions to avoid false positives.

To answer your question precisely, I have not met a case where a dependency is listed in the `package.xml` yet not found anywhere in any of the packages files. But even if it was the case, you could always add a simple rule such as `[[ ""$dep"" == ""SomeDependency"" ]] && [[ ""$pkg"" == ""SomePkg"" ]] && continue`.

```bash
$ colcon build --symlink-install --event-handlers=console_cohesion+ --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DBUILD_TESTING=False -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS='-fdiagnostics-color' -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-fdiagnostics-color' -GNinja

Before:
```
real	42m21.522s
user	257m55.620s
sys	17m22.792s
```

After:
```
real	42m17.404s
user	244m15.675s
sys	16m57.653s
```

The `real` time is not impacted much (not exactly sure why), but you can see `user` and `sys` times are reduced by a decent amount: 275m17 seconds of ""cpu time"" (user+sys) after compared to 287m17s before. That is +5% faster, just by removing unused stuff...!

There are a lot of `package.xml` to clean, any help to create PRs is welcomed :)

@kenji-miyake it's likely. Because when I opened the file with Illustrator and just saved it back without doing anything, it got reduced to 25KB.

I'd say it has normal priority. Keeping repo small in general is a good practice. And earlier we do this, better it is. Because these binary files keep making the .git folder larger and larger with no return.

I've realized this while investigating why the autoware folder was so large. Then realized these images and it'd be a good thing to do if anyone would like to spare some time.

It'd be the best if people who contributed these files put here the lighter versions instead, since we might lose some quality otherwise.",xmfcx,awf,,343,10,0,0,0,0

> Did you find any problem with git-lfs and change your mind?

We had a discussion with the Autoware Planning & Control team in the [WG meeting](https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions/3558).

@kenji-miyake 

The common agreement was that the draw.io metadata information (the binary blob) in the files are important for the team. We should keep them.

And to allow this, I had 2 solutions:
- Add `git-lfs` support for the image and binary files. (my preference)
- Replace the `.svg` files with smaller versions. But collect and host the original `.drawio.svg` files in some google drive, have links to them in the documentation. (too complicated and hard to maintain)

@esteve do you think adding `git-lfs` tracking to the generic image files in the middle of repository timeline might have any unknown side effects?

I would like to go with this option but we also need to update the documentation, maybe ansible scripts, maybe for certain CI actions (like mk-docs generation) to have this support.",xmfcx,awf,,343,10,0,0,0,0

This task is not important. Currently, [if a local type is used, it is overwritten with local coordinates after being projected with MGRS](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/blob/b255111b7b11df532a11817134c33ca36c92b498/map/map_loader/src/lanelet2_map_loader/lanelet2_map_loader_node.cpp#L102-L115), so there is a bit of processing waste.


Also, there may be cases where only some positions are overwritten with local coordinates. In this case, it is better to be able to specify a sub-projection type when using local projections.

I think splitting repos or just removing some is okay, but there are several things to be discussed:
1. Which perspective to divide

Do you really want to split drivers? Or do you want to split the entire sensor components? I'm not sure which is better. 

> Since not every vehicle will use all the drivers, it's better for them to have a separate driver.repos file.

Seeing this purpose, I feel like you want to split the sensor components that aren't related to your vehicle.

> This way when people fork autoware, it's easier for them to disable these repositories.

For this, I think users can do it with the current configuration because they are under the `sensor_component` section. :thinking:
Could you please show me some concrete examples?

2. Dependency

We might need to fix some dependencies before splitting them out.

- Users shouldn't be forced to build drivers that they won't use.
- The drivers should be tested in the repository through the CI to keep compatible.
- Some drivers are essential, like the nebula driver.

For this, I will separate out the following:
- `pacmod_interface`
- `tamagawa_imu_driver`
 
into a different `.repos` file called `extra-packages.repos`.

Will modify the CI to pull them along with the others, build and test as usual.

The users will download the usual `autoware.repos` without these packages.

If they want to, they can download it with the `extra-packages.repos`.

Although this would help a lot of ROS users, I would like to think carefully about the timing and the target package.
 
I propose to do this after we do a clean up of messages (replacing autoware_auto_msgs with autoware_msgs). This is because change in interface could be quite a disruptive change and we would like to have more organized interface before making it ROS ""official"" release.

Also, I think we should only release into the ROS buildfarm for the packages in Core considering the fact that we defined Core as AWF maintained package and Universe to be community maintained.

Absolutely! This issue is just meant to start the discussion and find out what steps we'd need if we ever want to release Autoware into the ROS buildfarm, but I don't think we're ready now to do it.



> I propose to do this after we do a clean up of messages (replacing autoware_auto_msgs with autoware_msgs). This is because change in interface could be quite a disruptive change and we would like to have more organized interface before making it ROS ""official"" release.

Sounds good. I found https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_msgs/issues/2 and I can work on it, if nobody else is working.

> Also, I think we should only release into the ROS buildfarm for the packages in Core considering the fact that we defined Core as AWF maintained package and Universe to be community maintained. Universe packages can be registered to ROS buildfarm by the owner of the package at their decision. As Core is currently empty, we should start with porting Universe packages into Core first before doing this task.

A priori I don't see the problem with releasing Autoware.Universe as well, but I understand that Autoware.Core is meant to be of higher quality, so it might make sense releasing it first.

However, the way package releases work with the ROS buildfarm is that [bloom](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Releasing/First-Time-Release.html#bloom-release) releases all the packages in a given repository (that's why it's required that all packages have the same version in their `package.xml`). So if we want to let community maintainers to release their packages on their own, they'll have to keep the packages in separate repositories and not all in Autoware.Universe. If anyone runs `bloom` on the Autoware.Universe repository, they'll release all the packages there.",esteve,tier4,,67172,3,0,0,0,0

Usually, dependencies like this, which are third-party library-ish and won't change the interface frequently, should be released to APT as vendor packages.
See an example below:
https://github.com/tier4/hash_library_vendor
https://github.com/tier4/hash_library_vendor-release

If it's still in the development stage, I think it's okay to add it to `autoware.repos` for now.
However, the roadmap to the ideal state should be managed via an issue.
Therefore, please describe the roadmap around this dependency management.

Also, to merge this, you must get approvals from AWF's architects (@xmfcx @mitsudome-r). So I'll request a review from them. (I'll also request a review from one of TIER IV's architects @yukkysaito .)",kenji-miyake,tier4,5914222,39049,5,2,0,1,5

I measured about a minute for a package that is already in ccache on the free Github VMs. We can speed it up by using a ram disk if we have more powerful VMs. Also we think about parallelizing the build.
Note that it is not enough to compare the diff in the repo itself as upstream dependencies could have changed and require a rebuild (ABI changes, message changes..).

Currently the package includes the date as a Debian revision to make sure new version are recognized as an update by apt. This is the same for the OSRF buildfarm. Generating a Debian revision only in case of a change is not trivial but we can discuss that.

This is the current diff, but not enough discussion. I would like to continue the discussion here.

>Currently the package includes the date as a Debian revision to make sure new version are recognized as an update by apt. This is the same for the OSRF buildfarm. Generating a Debian revision only in case of a change is not trivial but we can discuss that.

The autoware.universe repository contains a lot of packages, so versioning with tags is not suitable. Multiple versions of deb packages for each tag is generated even if the code of stable package hasn't changed. So in current repository structure, we need versioning for each package.

If versioning by tag, the autoware.universe repository should be divided into multiple small repositories. This allows the repository/package maintainers to set the version at their release timing.

~If using this method, It's need to deploy deb packages to another repository for distribution.~

I think that is a good idea in general (though unrelated to packaging) as monorepos do not work well with git.

I am thinking now...
On the negative side, some packages have dependencies between packages, and it is a pain to manage PR across packages when modifying functionality.

Are you considering a repository split for each package? Or per component?

Using `git describe --tags` will generate a version number specific to the used commit. It has the form `<tag>-<number of commits on top>-g<sha1 of commit>`. This makes sure that new commits have a higher version number (due to the counter) and that one can identify the commit belonging to the package (by the sha1).",jspricke,missing,,3696,30,0,0,0,0

After thinking about it, using tags is fine with for latest releases and nightly builds. For these, simply build the latest main branch or a specific tag. It's a bit unnatural for the version to be updated even if the package hasn't changed, but it doesn't matter.

My concern is for stable release. The reason I want to avoid using tags is that the Autoware repository is too large. Since the version of the repository is reflected in all packages, it is not possible to control the release timing for each package. This will the package is released with the latest code even if the package is not stable and maintainer want to provide the previous version as stable.

However, there is no problem with tag version at this stage. This is because the current Autoware is under development and it is difficult to provide a stable version. So as a first step, creating a tag for the entire autoware.universe and providing all packages with the same version of that tag is a reasonable choice.

In the future we need to support individual releases of packages. At this time, the version in package.xml is required, or split the repository. As @yukkysaito said, splitting the repository has the disadvantage of managing PR, but I hope that the code will be stable and easy to handle at this time.",isamu-takagi,tier4,,3696,30,0,0,0,0

There was one thing I misunderstood.
When we say ""use tags"", I think there are two meanings:
1. Update packages only when a new tag is released.
2. Use tag-based information (such as `git describe --tags`) to determine the package versions, but they are built regularly.

I imagined the No. 1, but it seems the important point is mainly the No. 2, right?
In that case, I think it'd be okay for now.

In the future, perhaps we can consider other options like ""updating packages only when package.xml is updated, and keeping all the versions (not only the latest) of deb packages."", as I mentioned above.

For example, prepare the following 3 channels/repositories:
1. Stable/autoware-deb-packages-stable
2. Beta (Latest release)/autoware-deb-packages-beta
3. Nightly/autoware-deb-packages-nightly

It's very similar to Rust's way.
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html

And set the different timings of updating the packages.
- Stable is updated when a maintainer manually updated the tag to use. It's assumed to be done after passing some tests such as scenario tests.
- Beta is updated when a new tag is pushed.
- Nightly is updated daily.

Then, users select the repository to use by changing the URL of add-apt-repository. (Or we can provide some commands to switch the channels.)

I have observed the same behaviour (`rviz2 window appear for a second and then closed.`) but on a single laptop screen (Dell XPS 15 9520 RTX 3050 Ti).

A solution to this is: 
1. Set your display to 1920x1080 or 100% scaling.
2. Start rviz2 with `rviz2 -d ~/autoware/install/autoware_launch/share/autoware_launch/rviz/autoware.rviz`
3. Uncheck the PointCloadMap visualization (Map > PointCloudMap). 
![image](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/assets/35192516/b43bf34e-d2ff-4273-a881-961be37ae7e5)
6. Save the autoware.rviz config.
7. Set the display back to your native resolution and desired scaling.
8. Start rviz2 again with `rviz2 -d ~/autoware/install/autoware_launch/share/autoware_launch/rviz/autoware.rviz`

This way the PointCloudMap topic is not visualized on startup since PointCloudMap consumes a lot of memory. I was able to enable the PointCloudMap again after startup. It seems that rviz2 consumes a lot of memory on launch when rendering on a 4K screen and unchecking PointCloudMap helps reduce the load. Hope this helps.",AhmadAmine998,upenn,27184331,557698,10,0,0,0,0
