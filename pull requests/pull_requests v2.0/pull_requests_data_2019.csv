You'll need to change your includes to prefix `lidar_point_pillars/` in all your sources includes.

If I'm not clear enough:
Currently you have this
```
├── include
│   ├── anchor_mask_cuda.h
│   ├── common.h
│   ├── nms_cuda.h
│   ├── point_pillars.h
│   ├── point_pillars_ros.h
│   ├── postprocess_cuda.h
│   ├── preprocess_points_cuda.h
│   ├── preprocess_points.h
│   └── scatter_cuda.h
```

Change it to:
```
├── include
│   └── lidar_point_pillars
│            ├── anchor_mask_cuda.h
│            ├── common.h

│            ├── preprocess_points_cuda.h
│            ├── preprocess_points.h
│            └── scatter_cuda.h
```
and update your source files, adding the `lidar_point_pillars` prefix:
i.e.
```
--- a/ros/src/computing/perception/detection/lidar_detector/packages/lidar_point_pillars/nodes/anchor_mask_cuda.cu
+++ b/ros/src/computing/perception/detection/lidar_detector/packages/lidar_point_pillars/nodes/anchor_mask_cuda.cu
@@ -16,7 +16,7 @@
 
 //headers in local files
-#include ""anchor_mask_cuda.h""
+#include ""lidar_point_pillars/anchor_mask_cuda.h""
```

Finally, change the install command to 
```

The rationale for doing it like this was that for a given version of Autoware, its corresponding Docker base image will have the dependencies pre-installed. If you are using this based to develop new features, then you will have to manually run rosdep again to complement the new dependencies required.

The effect on Docker's cache could be minimised with a list, but the cache would still be discarded eventually when the list gets updated. It is a trade-off between getting the dependencies automatically sorted out (instead of someone manually finding them out and updating the Dockerfile) vs increasing the usage of cache.
What do you think would be a better balance? Perhaps splitting ros-desktop-full and a few other basic ROS packages out into their own RUN command to at least re-use that layer? Move the rosdep step to be part of the build steps?

I'm not sure I understand the compatibility issue. Aren't these all deb packages which are meant to be compatible on the same distro?",filiperinaldi,261556958

I think having a list of known packages and then running rosdep install is a good compromise. OSRF has the process entirely automated in their images, perhaps in the future we could just have a script that runs rosdep install and if there are any new packages, add them to Dockerfile and commit the changes.

> I'm not sure I understand the compatibility issue. Aren't these all deb packages which are meant to be compatible on the same distro?

Unfortunately not. If I have packages installed from a previous sync and I install new ones, they are most certainly to crash because they are not ABI-compatible. ROS releases must be upgraded/installed all at once, you can't mix packages from different syncs, even if they are from the same distribution.",esteve,261556958
