@amc-nu If I understand correctly you guys keep documentation in: https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware-Manuals, no?

If that is correct I propose that @n-patiphon 
a )generates a pdf from above gdoc, 
b) uploads it https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware-Manuals/tree/master/en
c) We add the following line here: https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/blob/046b973dae7e21b1cfa73f772fade9557e5b1157/ros/src/sensing/filters/packages/points_preprocessor/nodes/ground_filter/ground_filter.cpp#L5
