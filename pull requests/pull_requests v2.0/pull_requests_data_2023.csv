I do not think it is a good idea to add it since it is a test msg inside TIER IV.

If it is to be added, I think it would be better to make a proposal to AWF whether or not to introduce a scenario simulator. Or if it is ecessary, we should put it in AWF repos",yukkysaito,1100969512

Thank you for the comments.
Let me confirm whether [scenarios_simulator_v2](https://github.com/tier4/scenario_simulator_v2) is being used as AWF's evaluator for the evaluation.
If scenario_simulator_v2 is tier4's specific repository, I think `scenario_simulator_v2_msgs` should be in https://github.com/tier4/tier4_autoware_msgs.

@mitsudome-r 
Do you know whether scenario_simulator_v2's position is AWF evaluator or tier4's evaluator?
(I heard scenario_simulator_v2 is being used by AWF's project but not sure if it's used as AWF's evaluator)",kyoichi-sugahara,1100969512

However, that does not mean it has to go into autoware_msgs. If you want to make this a core interface between Autoware Foundation and simulator in general, it should go into autoware_msgs.(i.e., if you want to add this to AD API or component interface)

If this topic is only meant to be used by TIER IV, then it should be merged into tier4_autoware_msgs.

In either case, I would like to see more description on what/how this message is used for. You wrote that this message is needed to merge this [pr](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/pull/2514), but description in the PR doesn't explain what you want to solve.

We have a message for simulation named `tier4_simulation_msgs` created previously in tier4_autoware_msgs repository, so making a draft [PR](https://github.com/tier4/tier4_autoware_msgs/pull/73), but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

I was not sure where we should place the proposal msg and that is kind of my concern. So we will put the msg in `tier4_simulation_msgs` for now.

The eagleye is not only used for autoware, but the packages you suggested are in autoware.universe or use their own messages, and they ware hard to incorporate them into ealgeye, so I did not modify or work on them this time.
Is it possible, for example, to manage those packages in autoware.universe and a separate repository?
