However, this shouldn't block you from refactoring OpenPlanner, we can always port it to ament after or during 1.11.\r\n\r\n> I am looking forward to use ROS2 with Autoware.\r\n\r\nSo am I! :-)\r\n\r\n> do you recommend to use ROS2 code style from now ?\r\n\r\nBoth styles are very very very similar, my recommendation is that you continue with the changes you're making and we merge them, and once we have the ament infrastructure in Autoware, we can port OpenPlanner to ament and check if your changes pass the ROS2 checks.\r\n\r\n> what is the difference between using \"ament\" and \"colcon\" as build tools ?\r\n\r\nBasically, a build system comprises the functions and macros that are added to a build definition to find a package's dependencies (e.g. the build_depend tags in package.xml help rosdep install the dependencies), how to generate messages, etc.\r\n\r\nA build tool is the program that knows how to read the metadata (package.xml) and the build definition (CMakeLists.txt) to produce a library or an executable.\r\n\r\nBack in ROS1, the build system and the build tool were the same: catkin. catkin_make could only build catkin packages. In ROS2, we introduced ament, the evolution of the catkin build system, and had to create ament_tools to support the ament build system.\r\n\r\nBut that was just too messy, because now you needed a different tool for a different build system, and to solve that, colcon was created. colcon understands packages that are written for the catkin (ROS1), ament (ROS2), CMake, setuptools (Python), Gradle (Java), etc. build systems, so we can now use the same tool for building workspaces that contain packages for different build systems.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge benefit for us, because we can have code written for ROS1 that use the catkin build system, but also ROS1 packages with the ROS2 build system (ament), and packages entirely written for ROS2 all in the same workspace. So instead of rewriting Autoware entirely for ROS2, we can do it step by step: first convert the build system of some of the packages to ament, add the ros1_bridge, add new packages that use ROS2, etc.\r\n\r\nThe link I pasted before is just an example of a ROS1 package, ported to ament and showing how the ament linters help keeping the code clean."

Here's what I think you should do:\r\n\r\n- Since this is not going into 1.11, you need to make a fork and do a new PR from there anyway.\r\n- In your fork, make one branch for each tool you are proposing so we can deal with each one individually.\r\n- For the tool using rosbag, make the necessary changes in the rosbag API so you don't need to circumvent it. Propose them in a PR to the rosbag repository.\r\n- Submit your tool as-is, but also submit a feature request to change it to use the changed rosbag API once that gets released in a ROS version we support (it is possible it would get released in Melodic if it doesn't change how the API is used for any other code).\r\n\r\nWe can accept the PR for that tool conditional on there being a proposal to change the rosbag API and your tool intending to use it in the future."

Just like a normal 2D slam on ROS Navigation stack, we dont need to create a lane on vector map.\r\n\r\n4) I tried to follow the instructions above but I could not get it working, the astar path wasn't out on Rviz, is that ok that you could upload your testing video on Youtube and share the link here?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

The two messages that were used - SteerMode and SpeedMode - will now live under automotive_platform_msgs and this will need to be changed in Autoware to use the apt installs.\r\n\r\nNote: This should not cause any changes with the current version of Autoware because the submodule is tied to a specific commit and a clone request for the previous repo name will redirect."

Unfortunately ROS workspaces are not easily relocatable, but a bit of `sed` fixes that:\r\n\r\n`find devel/ -type f -exec grep -Iq . {} \\; -and -exec sed -i -e 's#/sysroot/aarch64##g' {} \\;`\r\n\r\nThe following line is needed if the Autoware workspace is exported to the Docker container as a volume with a different path other than the one in the DrivePX (e.g. `/home/nvidia/Autoware`):\r\n\r\n`find devel/ -type f -exec grep -Iq . {} \\; -and -exec sed -i -e 's#PATH_ON_THE_HOST#/home/nvidia/Autoware#g' {} \\;`\r\n\r\n> @esteve just one Q - what would need to happen for this PR to also work the nvidia docker as e.g. in here: #1167?\r\n\r\nI'm working on that, but I wanted to get this first up for review. Here's what I'm doing now:\r\n\r\n- add the `x86_64` CUDA APT repository to the `sysroot` stage Docker\r\n- install the `cuda-*-cross-aarch64*` packages. Even if these packages are in the `x86_64` repository, they're actually targeting `arm64`. There are some packages (e.g. `cuda-license*`) that target the incorrect architecture (`all` instead of `x86_64`)\r\n- copy the libraries and configuration files from the `sysroot` intermediate stage to `/sysroot/aarch64` in the builder stage.\r\n\r\nI'm also trying to figure out how to this all without all the `sed` stuff, but I've given that a lower priority, as I wanted to have something working now that could be iterated from."

I've tried it myself and I can confirm that it successfully builds a docker image containing Autoware using nvidia-docker2.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should maintain support for nvidia-docker (v1) any more.  All (or at least most) of Nvidia's documentation now refers to version 2. We're just making life harder for ourselves by trying to support multiple setups.  On that basis I would remove the second argument 'nvidia' to the run.sh and build.sh files.\r\n\r\nI'm also doubtful that we should be compiling the Autoware source code into the docker image that we build.  In most other projects the docker image only serves to provide a consistent set of dependencies. After that it's common for the build script to mount the code in the newly created image and run build commands.\r\n\r\n"

                "comment_text": "@bdholt1, I agree on both that you should ditch nvidia-docker v1 and that it would be better to exclude source code from the docker image. That is how we use docker at our company too.\r\n\r\nThe docker image should provide you with a development environment in which you can compile the autoware code (i.e. with all compile-time dependencies available). You can also make a runtime image which contains all the compiled software, but I would advice you to look into catkin install targets to make the deployed filesystem cleaner. When using the install targets you specify a file structure which contains only the files that need to be deployed (e.g. the binaries, launch files, param files, but not the src/header files). Just take a look at any official ros package github repo (e.g. https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation) for an example.\r\n\r\nSome recommendations:\r\n- figure out catkin install targets, to more cleanly deploy the code.\r\n- consider switching to catkin_tools, rather than catkin_make. In my opinion, it is faster (especially for large catkin workspaces), cleaner, and more user friendly. It is created and maintained by the people behind ROS, but for some odd reason, it was never pushed as the official recommended successor of catkin_make (probably to avoid the migration troubles/frustrations that it would enforce to all ROS users). When switching you probably run into some cmake issues (as catkin_tools has no \"cmake crosstalk\" and thus is a bit more strict on your catkin correctness, i.e. the CMakeLists.xtx and package.xml). With catkin tools, just run `catkin config --install` (somewhat similar to `catkin_make install`) to enable the install space. Note that in ROS2, install targets will become obligatory (the devel workspace disappears in favor of the install workspace)..\r\n- make two images (check e.g. apollo images too https://hub.docker.com/r/apolloauto/apollo/tags/): \r\n  - `autoware-dev-<version>` -> no code, no actual autoware\r\n  - `autoware-release-<version>` -> containing deployed autoware code (no code, only binaries and \"share\" files like params / launch)\r\n- for each, you need to make an nvidia and a non nvidia version (the patch I provided will make opengl apps such as rviz work for nvidia, but then its broken on intel integrated graphics...). e.g.\r\n  - `autoware-dev-<version>-nvidia` and `autoware-dev-<version>`\r\n\r\nWe have a check_nvidia bash function that automatically can 'patch' a docker run command to take care, see this example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncheck_nvidia(){\r\n  if nvidia-smi &> /dev/null; then\r\n    export NV_RUN=\"--runtime=nvidia\"\r\n    export NV_TAG_SUFFIX=\"-nvidia\"\r\n  else\r\n    export NV_RUN=\"\"\r\n    export NV_TAG_SUFFIX=\"\"\r\n  fi\r\n}\r\n\r\n# adds GUI support and few other tricks\r\nexport DOCKER_COMMON_ARGS=\"--env=DISPLAY \\\r\n                           --env=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR \\\r\n                           --env=QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \\\r\n                           --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri \\\r\n                           -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \\\r\n                           -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro\"\r\n\r\nxhost +local:docker\r\ncheck_nvidia\r\ndocker run ${NV_RUN} ${DOCKER_COMMON_ARGS:?} -it --rm \\\r\n   --name=\"autoware\" \\\r\n   -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \\\r\n   -v /home/$USER/.Xauthority:/home/autoware/.Xauthority \\\r\n   -v \"$HOME/docker_shared:/home/autoware/docker_shared\" \\\r\n   -v autoware_home:/home/autoware \\\r\n   -v /media:/media \\\r\n   --net=host  \\\r\n   --add-host autoware:127.0.0.1 \\\r\n   --hostname=autoware \\\r\n   --privileged \\\r\n   autoware/autoware:1.7.0-kinetic${NV_TAG_SUFFIX}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeel free to do with this advice whatever you like.
